# VALIDATION INSTRUCTIONS
# ============================================================================

## Critical Tests (Must Pass):
- All project context integration tests (ensure user requirements captured)
- All high-level plan creation tests (ensure comprehensive planning)
- All resume system integration tests (ensure enhanced functionality)

## Expected Results:
- **Comprehensive Plan**: Complete project roadmap with all requirements
- **LLD Integration**: Plan properly integrates all LLD domain outputs
- **Enhanced Resume**: Resume system enhanced with plan-based capability
- **Implementation Ready**: Plan provides clear guidance for Module 7 and 8

## Test Distribution:
