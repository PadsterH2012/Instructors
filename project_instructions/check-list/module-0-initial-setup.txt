# Module 0: Initial Setup Validation
#
# Purpose: Validate initial project setup, infrastructure, and foundation
# Scope: Project structure, environment setup, infrastructure validation
# Importance: CRITICAL - Foundation module that all other modules depend on

# ============================================================================
# MODULE 0 (INITIAL SETUP)
# ============================================================================

## Module 0 Start Validation (MANDATORY)
- **GLOBAL RULES**: All global enforcement checkpoints passed | True/False
- **PREREQUISITES**: No prerequisites (first module) | N/A
- **INPUT VALIDATION**: project_plan.txt exists and readable | True/False
- **WORKING DIRECTORY**: Current working directory context established | True/False
- **STATUS CHECK**: No prior status file exists (fresh start) | True/False

## Project Structure Creation
- Initial Setup Started | Working Directory Established and Confirmed | True/False
- Project Structure | project_working_files Directory Created | True/False
- Archive Management | archivebin Directory Created at Same Level as project_working_files | True/False
- Version Control | .gitignore Setup for project_instructions | True/False

## Environment Validation
- Setup Completion | Current Working Directory (pwd) Established | True/False
- Date/Time Reference | Local Machine Date/Time Saved to Reference File | True/False
- Project Plan | project_instructions/project_input/project_plan.txt Validated | True/False

## Infrastructure Setup
- Directory Structure | Proper directory hierarchy established | True/False
- File Permissions | Appropriate file permissions set | True/False
- Path Validation | All paths calculated relative to working directory | True/False
- Safety Measures | project_working_files can be safely deleted without affecting instructions | True/False

## Project Context Creation
- Project Context | project_context.md created with user responses | True/False
- System Information | system_info.env created with environment details | True/False
- Context Validation | Project context properly captures user requirements | True/False
- Environment Context | System environment properly documented | True/False

## Module 0 Completion Validation (MANDATORY)
- **OUTPUT VALIDATION**: All required directory structure and files created | True/False
- **QUALITY GATES**: All setup files contain required content | True/False
- **INTEGRATION TEST**: File paths and structure ready for subsequent modules | True/False
- **STATUS UPDATE**: Status file created and Module 0 marked complete | True/False
- **GLOBAL COMPLIANCE**: All global rules maintained throughout module | True/False

# ============================================================================
# CRITICAL SETUP REQUIREMENTS
# ============================================================================

## Foundation Requirements:
- **Working Directory**: Established and confirmed before any operations
- **Project Structure**: Complete directory hierarchy created
- **Infrastructure**: archivebin and .gitignore properly configured
- **Context Capture**: User requirements and system environment documented

## Safety Requirements:
- **Isolation**: project_instructions folder remains untouched
- **Safety Design**: project_working_files can be deleted without system damage
- **Path Safety**: All file operations use relative paths from working directory
- **Permission Safety**: Appropriate file permissions prevent accidental damage

## Quality Requirements:
- **Complete Setup**: All required files and directories created
- **Proper Content**: All setup files contain required information
- **Validation Ready**: Structure ready for subsequent module operations
- **Status Tracking**: Accurate status tracking established

# ============================================================================
# VALIDATION INSTRUCTIONS
# ============================================================================

## Critical Tests (Must Pass):
- All project structure creation tests (foundation for all other modules)
- All environment validation tests (ensure proper context establishment)
- All infrastructure setup tests (ensure safety and proper organization)

## Expected Results:
- **Complete Foundation**: All required infrastructure established
- **Safety Compliance**: Safe file organization and operation structure
- **Context Capture**: User requirements and environment properly documented
- **Ready for Module 1**: All prerequisites for research phase established

## Total Module 0 Tests: 20
## Expected Pass Rate: 100% (All tests critical for system foundation)
## Impact Level: CRITICAL (Module 0 failures prevent all subsequent modules)
