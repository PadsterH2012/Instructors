# ============================================================================
# CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT POINTS
# ============================================================================

## Universal Scalability Enforcement (All Projects):
- **NO ARTIFICIAL FILE LIMITS**: System rejects arbitrary file count restrictions
- **COMPLEXITY-DRIVEN**: File count determined by content complexity, not pre-assignment
- **TOPIC SPANNING**: Large topics properly split across multiple files with clear part indicators
- **COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE**: All required areas documented regardless of file count
- **800-LINE GUIDELINE**: Individual files kept manageable for agent editing effectiveness

## Universal Documentation Validation (All Projects):
- **BLOCKING MECHANISM**: Missing documentation prevents LLD progression
- **VERIFICATION REQUIRED**: Each LLD must include documentation verification section
- **EXISTS VALIDATION**: All documentation files must be marked as EXISTS
- **PROJECT-FOCUSED**: Documentation organized for project support and development needs

## Conditional Domain Enforcement:
- **IF Database Used**: Database design, security, and optimization adequately covered
- **IF Frontend Exists**: UI/UX design, user flows, and frontend architecture documented
- **IF APIs Provided**: API design, security, and integration patterns documented
- **IF DevOps Required**: Infrastructure, deployment, and monitoring strategies documented
- **IF Simple Project**: Core domains only, skip unused technology domains

## Universal Quality Gate Enforcement (All Projects):
- **SIZE MANAGEMENT**: LLD files split when exceeding 800-line guideline for manageability
- **LOGICAL SPLITTING**: Content split by logical boundaries, not arbitrary limits
- **CROSS-REFERENCES**: Proper integration between LLD files maintained
- **RESEARCH INTEGRATION**: All LLD content based on validated research from Module 1

# VALIDATION INSTRUCTIONS
# ============================================================================

## Critical Tests (Must Pass):
- All universal scalability enforcement tests (prevent artificial limitations - all projects)
- All universal documentation validation tests (ensure comprehensive project documentation - all projects)
- All conditional domain tests (ensure appropriate domain coverage based on project requirements)
- All completion validation tests (prevent shortcuts and partial completion - all projects)

## Expected Results:
- **Universal Scalability**: No artificial file limits, complexity-driven file creation (all projects)
- **Project Documentation**: Complete project documentation with logical hierarchy (all projects)
- **Conditional Domain Coverage**: Appropriate domain coverage based on project technology requirements
- **Universal Quality**: All LLD files meet standards and integrate properly (all projects)
- **Complete Coverage**: All applicable areas documented, no shortcuts taken

## Test Distribution:
- **Universal Tests**: 25 tests (apply to all projects - scalability, documentation validation, quality)
- **Database Domain Tests**: 5 tests (apply only if databases used)
- **Frontend Domain Tests**: 5 tests (apply only if user interface exists)
- **API Domain Tests**: 5 tests (apply only if APIs provided)
- **DevOps Domain Tests**: 5 tests (apply only if deployment/infrastructure required)

## Total Module 3 Tests: 45 (25 universal + up to 20 conditional based on project domains)
## Expected Pass Rate: 100% (All applicable tests critical for system scalability and quality)
## Impact Level: CRITICAL (Module 3 failures affect entire system scalability and implementation quality)
