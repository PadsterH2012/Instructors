# ============================================================================
# CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT POINTS
# ============================================================================

## Environment-Appropriate Enforcement:
- **ENVIRONMENT CONSISTENCY**: Development approach matches chosen environment type
- **NO MANUAL PACKAGE EDITING**: Dependencies managed via package managers (all environments)
- **PROPER ISOLATION**: Development environment properly isolated regardless of type
- **REPRODUCIBLE SETUP**: Environment can be reproduced from documentation

## Docker-Specific Enforcement (IF Docker is used):
- **NO SYSTEM INSTALLATIONS**: All packages installed in containers only
- **CONTAINER TESTING**: All testing performed within Docker environment
- **NO DIRECT INSTALLATION**: No direct package installation in running containers
- **REBUILD WORKFLOW**: All package changes go through container rebuild process

## Local Development Enforcement (IF local environment is used):
- **VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS**: Proper isolation using venv, conda, or similar
- **SYSTEM PROTECTION**: Host system protected from development package pollution
- **DEPENDENCY ISOLATION**: Project dependencies isolated from system packages
- **LOCAL TESTING**: Testing environment properly configured for local development

## Quality Enforcement:
- **TEST EXECUTION**: Tests not only created but also executed
- **NO WORKAROUNDS**: Code fixed when tests fail, no workarounds allowed
- **ISSUE TRACKING**: All issues logged and tracked
- **PERFORMANCE VALIDATION**: Performance requirements tested and validated

## Implementation Standards:
- **LLD REFERENCE**: All decisions based on existing LLD documentation
- **FOUNDATION LEVERAGE**: Maximum leverage of work from previous modules
- **INCREMENTAL DEVELOPMENT**: Follows task breakdown from tracking system
- **SCRIPT ORGANIZATION**: Proper separation of testing and application scripts

## Specification Fidelity Enforcement:
- **LLD AUTHORITY**: LLD specifications are definitive implementation authority, not suggestions
- **NO IMPROVISATION**: Agents implement exactly what's specified, no training default substitution
- **SPECIFICATION VALIDATION**: Each component validated against LLD before proceeding
- **PATTERN COMPLIANCE**: Implementation follows specified patterns, not agent preferences
- **INTEGRATION FIDELITY**: Component interactions follow LLD specifications exactly

# ============================================================================
# VALIDATION INSTRUCTIONS
# ============================================================================

## Critical Tests (Must Pass):
- All LLD specification compliance tests (ensure exact implementation of LLD specifications - all projects)
- All specification authority enforcement tests (ensure LLD authority over agent defaults - all projects)
- All environment-appropriate development tests (ensure proper development environment setup)
- All quality validation tests (ensure code quality and testing)
- All implementation standards tests (ensure proper development practices)

## Expected Results:
- **Specification Fidelity**: Implementation exactly matches LLD specifications with no agent improvisation
- **LLD Authority**: LLD specifications override agent training defaults in all implementation decisions
- **Environment-Appropriate**: Development environment matches project requirements and chosen approach
- **Quality Assurance**: All code tested and meeting quality standards
- **Standards Compliance**: Proper development practices followed regardless of environment
- **Foundation Leverage**: Effective use of previous module outputs

## Test Distribution:
- **Universal Tests**: 35 tests (apply to all projects - includes specification compliance)
- **Docker-Specific Tests**: 5 tests (apply only if Docker used)
- **Local Development Tests**: 5 tests (apply only if local development used)

## Total Module 8 Tests: 45 (35 universal + up to 10 conditional based on environment)
## Expected Pass Rate: 100% (All applicable tests critical for implementation quality)
## Impact Level: HIGH (Module 8 determines final implementation quality)
