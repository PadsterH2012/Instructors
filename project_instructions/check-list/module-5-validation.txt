# Module 5: HLD Coverage Analysis and Validation Planning
#
# Purpose: Validate HLD coverage completeness against LLD specifications, then perform validation and planning
# Scope: HLD vs LLD gap analysis, documentation consistency, research integration, project planning
# HLD Coverage Analysis: Compare HLD contents against combined LLD files to identify discrepancies and missing elements
# Importance: CRITICAL - Ensures LLD specifications completely implement HLD design before implementation planning
