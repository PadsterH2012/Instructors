# Master Documentation Index

## CRITICAL: Self-Referencing Documentation System

**THIS FILE IS THE PRIMARY REFERENCE FOR ALL DESIGN DECISIONS**

All agents MUST check this documentation before making any design decisions. This documentation serves as the single source of truth for the current system setup and established standards.

## Usage Guidelines for Agents

### Before Making Any Design Decision:
1. **Read this index** to understand current system setup
2. **Check relevant domain documentation** for established patterns
3. **Review related LLD files** for technical implementation details
4. **Verify consistency** with existing standards and decisions
5. **Update documentation** when implementing new features or changes

### When Creating New Documentation:
1. **Follow established patterns** documented in this system
2. **Reference existing standards** rather than creating new ones
3. **Update this index** when adding new documentation domains
4. **Maintain cross-references** between related documentation
5. **Ensure parallel updates** to both LLD and application documentation

### When Modifying Existing Systems:
1. **Check impact** on other documented systems
2. **Update all affected documentation** simultaneously
3. **Maintain consistency** across all documentation domains
4. **Preserve decision history** and rationale
5. **Validate changes** against established standards

## Maintenance and Updates

This documentation system is designed to be self-maintaining and self-referencing. As new features are added or existing systems are modified, the documentation should be updated to reflect these changes and serve as the authoritative reference for future development.
