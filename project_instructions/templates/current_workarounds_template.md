# Current Workarounds Log

## Purpose
This file tracks temporary workarounds that require proper fixes. Workarounds are temporary solutions that should be replaced with proper implementations as soon as possible.

## Workaround Status Definitions
- **ACTIVE**: Workaround currently in use, needs proper fix
- **SCHEDULED**: Proper fix planned for specific phase
- **IN_PROGRESS**: Working on replacing workaround with proper solution
- **RESOLVED**: Proper fix implemented, workaround removed

## Active Workarounds

### Workaround #001

**Summary**: [Brief descriptive name]
**Phase Implemented**: [Module X.Y - Phase Name]
**Description**: [What workaround was implemented and why]
**Root Issue**: [The underlying problem that caused the workaround]
**Temporary Solution**: [Exact workaround implemented]
**Proper Fix Required**: [What the correct solution should be]
**Priority**: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
**Date Logged**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Target Resolution**: [Planned phase for proper fix]
**Last Updated**: [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Instructions for Workaround Management

### When to Log a Workaround
- Temporary fix implemented to unblock progress
- Quick solution used instead of proper implementation
- Configuration change made to bypass a problem
- Test disabled or modified to avoid failure
- Dependency downgraded or changed to resolve conflict

### Workaround Resolution Process
1. **Document**: Log the workaround immediately when implemented
2. **Plan**: Schedule proper fix for appropriate phase
3. **Track**: Monitor impact and ensure it doesn't cause other issues
4. **Replace**: Implement proper solution as planned
5. **Validate**: Ensure proper fix works and remove workaround
6. **Remove**: Delete resolved workarounds from this log

### Priority Guidelines
- **HIGH**: Workaround affects security, performance, or core functionality
- **MEDIUM**: Workaround affects quality or maintainability
- **LOW**: Minor workarounds with minimal impact

### Workaround Numbering
- Use sequential numbering: #001, #002, #003, etc.
- Never reuse numbers, even after resolution
- Maintain chronological order of implementation

## Resolution Requirements
- All HIGH priority workarounds MUST be replaced with proper fixes before project completion
- MEDIUM priority workarounds should be addressed in subsequent phases
- LOW priority workarounds should be documented for future improvement
- NO workaround should remain ACTIVE indefinitely without a resolution plan

## Integration with Module 8
- Review this log at the end of each implementation phase
- Replace workarounds with proper fixes when possible
- Update STATUS_README.md with workaround resolution progress
- Include workaround resolution in phase completion validation

## Workaround Prevention
- Always attempt proper fix first before implementing workaround
- Document why proper fix cannot be implemented immediately
- Set clear timeline for replacing workaround with proper solution
- Consider impact on other components before implementing workaround
