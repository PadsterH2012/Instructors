# Simulate Mode Log

## Purpose
This file logs all actions that would be performed in simulate mode without actually executing them.

## Simulation Configuration
**Level**: [1-9] (1=Basic, 5=Medium, 9=Intensive)
**Switches**: [--simulate-testing, --simulate-debug, --simulate-upgrade, --simulate-deployment]
**Project Type**: [Detected from project context or specified]
**Working Directory**: [Full path where agent is executing - MUST be established at start]
**Project Root**: [Full path to project root directory]

## Simulation Levels
- **Level 1-3**: Basic projects (static sites, simple apps, basic auth)
- **Level 4-6**: Medium projects (multi-feature apps, integrations, microservices)
- **Level 7-9**: Intensive projects (enterprise systems, full testing, production-ready)

## Log Format
```
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS | SIMULATE | LEVEL | ACTION_TYPE | FULL_COMMAND_OR_OPERATION
```

## Action Types with Full Command Examples
- **CREATE**: Directory or file creation with full paths
  - `mkdir -p /full/path/to/directory`
  - `touch /full/path/to/file.txt`
- **COPY**: File copy operations with full source and destination paths
  - `cp /source/path/file.txt /destination/path/file.txt`
- **MOVE**: File move operations with full paths
  - `mv /source/path/file.txt /destination/path/file.txt`
- **RUN**: Command execution with full working directory context
  - `cd /working/directory && docker-compose build --no-cache`
- **TEST**: Test script execution with full paths (if --simulate-testing)
  - `cd /project/path && ./scripts/test_database.sh`
- **DEBUG**: Debug operations with full commands (if --simulate-debug)
  - `cd /project/path && docker logs container_name`
- **UPGRADE**: Upgrade operations with full commands (if --simulate-upgrade)
  - `cd /project/path && curl -sSL https://example.com/upgrade.sh | bash`
- **DEPLOY**: Deployment operations with full commands (if --simulate-deployment)
  - `cd /project/path && kubectl apply -f manifests/`
- **VALIDATE**: Validation checks with full commands
  - `cd /project/path && docker-compose ps`
- **RESEARCH**: API calls for research (with context)
  - `brave_web_search: "Docker best practices 2024" (for /project/path optimization)`
- **UPDATE**: File content updates with full paths and content preview
  - `echo "content preview..." >> /full/path/to/file.txt`

## Simulate Mode Rules
- API calls scale with level: Level 1-3 (1 call), Level 4-6 (2 calls), Level 7-9 (3 calls)
- Operations complexity increases with level
- Switches add specific operation types to simulation
- Include timestamps and level for all simulated actions
- Keep entries concise and actionable

## Accuracy Tracking System

### Post-Execution Accuracy Assessment
After actual execution, mark each phase/module with accuracy percentage:

**Accuracy Categories**:
- **File Operations** (25%): Did simulated file operations match actual execution?
- **Command Execution** (25%): Did simulated commands match what was actually run?
- **API Calls** (20%): Did simulated research match actual research performed?
- **Time Estimates** (15%): How close were simulated time estimates to actual execution?
- **Issue Prediction** (15%): Did simulation predict actual issues encountered?

**Accuracy Marking Format**:
```
=== ACCURACY ASSESSMENT ===
Phase: [Phase Name]
Module: [Module Number]
Overall Accuracy: [XX%]
- File Operations: [XX%] - [Brief explanation]
- Command Execution: [XX%] - [Brief explanation]
- API Calls: [XX%] - [Brief explanation]
- Time Estimates: [XX%] - [Brief explanation]
- Issue Prediction: [XX%] - [Brief explanation]
Notes: [Additional observations]
Assessed By: [Agent/Human]
Assessment Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
```

**Example Accuracy Assessment**:
```
=== ACCURACY ASSESSMENT ===
Phase: Environment and Configuration Implementation
Module: Module 8.2
Overall Accuracy: 87%
- File Operations: 95% - All Docker files created as simulated, minor path differences
- Command Execution: 90% - Docker commands matched, additional troubleshooting commands needed
- API Calls: 80% - Simulated 2 calls, actually needed 3 for Docker optimization
- Time Estimates: 75% - Estimated 20 min, actual 26 min due to container issues
- Issue Prediction: 85% - Predicted Docker build issues, missed network configuration problem
Notes: Simulation was very close to actual execution, good predictive accuracy
Assessed By: Claude-Agent-v2
Assessment Date: 2024-12-19
