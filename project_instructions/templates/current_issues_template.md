# Current Issues Log

## Purpose
This file tracks active issues that require resolution. Issues should be addressed as soon as possible, preferably at the end of the current phase or when resources become available.

## Issue Status Definitions
- **OPEN**: Issue identified, needs investigation or resolution
- **IN_PROGRESS**: Actively working on resolution
- **BLOCKED**: Cannot proceed due to external dependency
- **RESOLVED**: Issue fixed, ready for removal from this log

## Instructions for Issue Management

### When to Log an Issue
- Implementation doesn't match LLD specifications
- Tests fail and require code changes
- Docker containers have persistent problems
- Dependencies have compatibility issues
- Performance problems identified
- Security concerns discovered
- Documentation inconsistencies found

### Issue Resolution Process
1. **Identify**: Log the issue immediately when discovered
2. **Prioritize**: Assign priority based on impact
3. **Investigate**: Research root cause and solutions
4. **Resolve**: Implement proper fix (no workarounds)
5. **Validate**: Test the resolution thoroughly
6. **Remove**: Delete resolved issues from this log

### Priority Guidelines
- **HIGH**: Blocks progress, affects core functionality, security issues
- **MEDIUM**: Affects quality, performance, or user experience
- **LOW**: Minor issues, cosmetic problems, nice-to-have improvements

### Issue Numbering
- Use sequential numbering: #001, #002, #003, etc.
- Never reuse numbers, even after resolution
- Maintain chronological order of discovery

## Resolution Requirements
- All HIGH priority issues MUST be resolved before phase completion
- MEDIUM priority issues should be resolved when possible
- LOW priority issues can be deferred but should not be ignored
- NO issue should remain OPEN indefinitely without progress

## Integration with Module 8
- Review this log at the end of each implementation phase
- Address issues before proceeding to next phase when possible
- Update STATUS_README.md with issue resolution progress
- Include issue resolution in phase completion validation
