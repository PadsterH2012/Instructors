# Module 2: Documentation Development (MANDATORY)

## Overview
This module contains directives for creating project scope documentation and high-level design documentation. All documentation must be based on validated research findings from Module 1.

## Prerequisites
- Module 1 (Research Phase) must be completed and validated
- All research deliverables must exist:
  - research_findings.md
  - component_compatibility.md
  - industry_standards.md
  - validated_tech_stack.md

## Execution Directives

### 2.1 Project Scope Documentation

Execute the following scope documentation steps:

1. **Project Scope Creation**
   - Create project_scope.md in the project folder (relative to instruction.md) based on the project plan file
   - Ensure scope is clearly defined with measurable objectives
   - Include constraints, assumptions, and dependencies
   - Document key stakeholders and their requirements

2. **Scope Documentation Requirements**
   - Include comprehensive project scope with:
     - Project objectives and goals
     - Functional and non-functional requirements
     - Project constraints and limitations
     - Assumptions and dependencies
     - Stakeholder requirements and expectations
     - Success criteria and acceptance criteria

### 2.2 High-Level Design Documentation

Execute the following HLD creation steps:

1. **Prerequisites Verification**
   - PREREQUISITE: Must complete Research Phase (Module 1 sections 1.1-1.4) before proceeding
   - Verify all research deliverables are complete and validated

2. **HLD Creation Process**
   - Create project_hld.md in the project folder (relative to instruction.md) based on project_scope.md
   - MANDATORY: Base all technology choices on validated_tech_stack.md from Research Phase
   - Incorporate findings from research_findings.md, component_compatibility.md, and industry_standards.md
   - Include system architecture, component interactions, and technology stack
   - Document key design decisions and their rationale with references to research findings

3. **HLD Documentation Requirements**
   - Include comprehensive high-level design with:
     - System architecture overview
     - Component interactions and interfaces
     - Technology stack (from validated_tech_stack.md)
     - Design decisions with research-based rationale
     - Integration points between components
     - Security architecture (from industry standards research)
     - Performance considerations (from best practices research)

### 2.3 Technology Stack Documentation

Execute the following techstack documentation steps:

1. **Technology Stack File Creation**
   - Create techstack.md in the project folder (relative to instruction.md) with:
     - Comprehensive list of all technologies used (from validated_tech_stack.md)
     - Latest stable version requirements for each component (researched and validated)
     - Reusable components that can be shared across the project
     - Integration points between different technologies (from compatibility research)
     - References to relevant documentation and resources (from Context7 research)
     - Security considerations for each technology (from industry standards research)
     - Performance optimization recommendations (from best practices research)

2. **Technology Stack Documentation Requirements**
   - Include detailed technology specifications with:
     - Complete technology inventory with versions
     - Component compatibility matrix
     - Integration guidelines and best practices
     - Security requirements for each technology
     - Performance optimization strategies
     - References to research sources and documentation

### 2.4 Research Validation Checkpoint

Execute the following validation checkpoint:

1. **Research Deliverables Verification**
   - MANDATORY: Verify that Research Phase deliverables are complete before proceeding:
     - research_findings.md exists and contains comprehensive technology research
     - component_compatibility.md exists and documents integration considerations
     - industry_standards.md exists and covers security/performance standards
     - validated_tech_stack.md exists and provides final technology recommendations

2. **Validation Requirements**
   - If any research deliverable is missing or incomplete, return to Research Phase
   - All subsequent documentation MUST reference and build upon these research findings
   - Ensure all technology choices in HLD and techstack.md align with validated research

## Validation Checkpoint

Before proceeding to Module 3, verify that all deliverables are complete:

- [ ] project_scope.md exists and contains comprehensive project scope
- [ ] project_hld.md exists and incorporates all research findings
- [ ] techstack.md exists and aligns with validated_tech_stack.md
- [ ] All documentation references research findings appropriately
- [ ] Technology choices are consistent across all documents

**MANDATORY**: If any documentation deliverable is missing or incomplete, repeat the relevant documentation steps. All subsequent modules MUST reference and build upon these documentation outputs.

## Output Files
- project_scope.md
- project_hld.md
- techstack.md

## Next Module
Upon successful completion and validation, proceed to Module 3: LLD Structure and Creation.
