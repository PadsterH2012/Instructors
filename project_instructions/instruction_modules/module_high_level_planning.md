# Module 6: High-Level Project Planning (MANDATORY)

## CRITICAL: Project Planning Rules

**MANDATORY COMPLETION REQUIREMENT**:
- Modules 0-5 MUST be COMPLETED before executing this module
- All research findings, documentation, and LLD outputs must exist and be validated
- This module creates the master project roadmap based on all previous work

**USER INTERACTION REQUIREMENT**:
- This module REQUIRES direct user interaction to determine project scope and constraints
- Agents MUST query the user for project context before proceeding with planning
- Planning decisions MUST be based on user responses, not assumptions

**INTEGRATION REQUIREMENT**:
- This module integrates with the resume system to provide plan-based progress tracking
- High-level plan becomes the primary progress tracking mechanism when created
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing status.md system

---

## Overview
This module creates a comprehensive, actionable project roadmap by synthesizing all research findings, documentation, and design outputs from Modules 1-5. It provides user-specific planning based on project scope (MVP, home project, or production system) and creates a master plan for project execution.

## Prerequisites
- **Modules 0-5 must be COMPLETED** - verify in ../../project_working_files/status.md
- Project context file exists: ../../project_working_files/project_context.md (from Module 0)
- All research files exist in ../../project_working_files/working_files/research/
- All documentation exists in ../../project_working_files/docs/
- All LLD files exist in ../../project_working_files/working_files/design/
- Self-referencing documentation system is established

## Execution Directives

### 6.1 Project Context Integration

Execute the following context integration steps:

1. **Read Project Context from Module 0**
   - Read ../../project_working_files/project_context.md (created in Module 0)
   - Extract user responses and architectural implications
   - Review context analysis and technology guidance
   - Understand scalability requirements and deployment strategy

2. **Context Validation and Clarification**
   - Confirm project context is still accurate with user
   - Ask for any updates or changes since Module 0
   - Clarify any ambiguous requirements for planning
   - Document any new context or changes

3. **Planning Approach Determination**
   - Use project context to determine appropriate planning template
   - Identify complexity level and architectural approach
   - Note specific requirements and constraints from context
   - Align planning with long-term vision and growth potential

### 6.2 MVP Planning (If Applicable)

If user indicates MVP scope, provide these 5 progressive development examples:

1. **Basic Function (Phase 1)**
   - Core feature implementation only
   - Minimal UI/UX (functional but basic)
   - Local development environment
   - Basic testing (manual verification)
   - Example: User authentication + single core feature

2. **Enhanced Function (Phase 2)**
   - Core feature + 1-2 supporting features
   - Improved UI/UX design
   - Basic error handling
   - Unit testing for core functions
   - Example: Authentication + core feature + basic admin panel

3. **Intermediate Function (Phase 3)**
   - Multiple integrated features
   - Responsive design implementation
   - Database optimization
   - Integration testing
   - Basic deployment setup
   - Example: Full user management + 3-4 core features + API

4. **Advanced Function (Phase 4)**
   - Full feature set from LLD modules
   - Complete UI/UX implementation
   - Performance optimization
   - Comprehensive testing suite
   - Staging environment setup
   - Example: Complete application with all planned features

5. **Production-Ready Function (Phase 5)**
   - Production deployment
   - Monitoring and logging
   - Security hardening
   - Documentation completion
   - Maintenance procedures
   - Example: Live system with full operational support

### 6.3 High-Level Plan Creation

Execute the following plan creation steps:

1. **Comprehensive Data Gathering**
   - Read all research findings from ../../project_working_files/working_files/research/
   - Review all documentation from ../../project_working_files/docs/

   - **MANDATORY**: Review self-referencing documentation system in ../../project_working_files/docs/documentation/
   - Extract specific technical details, implementation requirements, and dependencies from all sources

2. **Gap Analysis and Additional Research**
   - Identify areas where LLD and documentation lack sufficient detail for task creation
   - **USE RESEARCH TOOLS** when existing documentation is insufficient:
     - Use `brave_web_search` for additional technical information
     - Use `Context7` tools for specific component implementation details
     - Research best practices for identified technical gaps
   - Document additional research findings and integrate into plan

3. **Create Comprehensive Master Project Plan**
   - Create ../../project_working_files/docs/high_level_plan.md
   - Structure plan based on user's project type and requirements
   - **MANDATORY**: Include detailed tasks and subtasks derived from ALL 5 LLD domains
   - Integrate information from self-referencing documentation system
   - Add status tracking and completion checkboxes with testing workflow
   - Cross-reference all previous module outputs and additional research

4. **Plan Structure Requirements**
   The high_level_plan.md file must include:
   - Project overview and scope (based on user input)
   - Testing requirements flag (testing required/no testing required)
   - Phase breakdown with clear milestones
   - **MANDATORY**: Detailed tasks and subtasks derived from ALL 5 LLD domains
   - **MANDATORY**: Integrated testing and documentation workflow for each task

   - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
   - Phase completion validation requirements

### 6.4 High-Level Plan Template

Use this template structure for creating high_level_plan.md:

```markdown
# High-Level Project Plan

## Project Overview
- **Project Type**: [MVP/Home Project/Production System]

## Task Execution Workflow

**Standard Task Completion Sequence** (unless marked "no testing required"):

2. Write and implement tests for newly added code (if testing required)
3. All tests must pass before task can be marked complete
4. Update all relevant documentation to reflect code changes, new functionality, and tests
5. Only after steps 1-4 are complete can the next task begin

**Phase Completion Validation** (if testing required):
- Run full test suite for all code in the phase
- All tests must pass before phase can be marked complete
- Update phase documentation and cross-references

### 6.5 Resume System Integration

Execute the following resume system updates:

1. **Update Resume System Logic**
   - Modify ../../project_instructions/instruction_modules/module_resume_system.md
   - Add high_level_plan.md detection and priority logic
   - Implement plan-based resume capability
   - Maintain backward compatibility with status.md

2. **Plan-Based Resume Logic**
   When high_level_plan.md exists:
   - Use plan phases and tasks as primary progress tracking
   - Resume from first incomplete task in current phase
   - Update plan status as work progresses
   - Fall back to status.md only if plan is corrupted or missing

3. **Integration Requirements**
   - Plan-based resume takes priority over status.md resume
   - Both systems must remain functional for backward compatibility
   - Plan updates must be atomic to prevent corruption
   - Clear error handling for plan file issues
