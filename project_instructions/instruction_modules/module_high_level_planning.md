# Module 6: High-Level Project Planning (MANDATORY)

## CRITICAL: Project Planning Rules

**MANDATORY COMPLETION REQUIREMENT**:
- Modules 0-5 MUST be COMPLETED before executing this module
- All research findings, documentation, and LLD outputs must exist and be validated
- This module creates the master project roadmap based on all previous work

**USER INTERACTION REQUIREMENT**:
- This module REQUIRES direct user interaction to determine project scope and constraints
- Agents MUST query the user for project context before proceeding with planning
- Planning decisions MUST be based on user responses, not assumptions

**INTEGRATION REQUIREMENT**:
- This module integrates with the resume system to provide plan-based progress tracking
- High-level plan becomes the primary progress tracking mechanism when created
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing status.md system

---

## Overview
This module creates a comprehensive, actionable project roadmap by synthesizing all research findings, documentation, and design outputs from Modules 1-5. It provides user-specific planning based on project scope (MVP, home project, or production system) and creates a master plan for project execution.

## Prerequisites
- **Modules 0-5 must be COMPLETED** - verify in ../../project_working_files/status.md
- Project context file exists: ../../project_working_files/project_context.md (from Module 0)
- All research files exist in ../../project_working_files/working_files/research/
- All documentation exists in ../../project_working_files/docs/
- All LLD files exist in ../../project_working_files/working_files/design/
- Self-referencing documentation system is established

## Execution Directives

   - Update plan status as work progresses
   - Fall back to status.md only if plan is corrupted or missing

3. **Integration Requirements**
   - Plan-based resume takes priority over status.md resume
   - Both systems must remain functional for backward compatibility
   - Plan updates must be atomic to prevent corruption
   - Clear error handling for plan file issues

     ```
   - **PUSH**: Push committed changes to remote repository
   - **VALIDATE**: Confirm git repository is clean and synchronized

### 6.7 Status File Archiving

Execute the following status archiving steps:

1. **Archive Status File**
   - The high_level_plan.md now serves as the primary project roadmap
   - Move status.md to archivebin to maintain clean working directory
   - Preserve status.md as backup for troubleshooting and resume system fallback

2. **Archiving Process**
   ```bash
   # Create archive with timestamp
   cp ../../project_working_files/status.md ../../archivebin/status_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).md

   # Move original to archive
   mv ../../project_working_files/status.md ../../archivebin/status.md
   ```

3. **Archive Validation**
   - Verify status.md has been moved to archivebin/
   - Confirm high_level_plan.md exists and is complete
   - Ensure resume system can still access archived status if needed

4. **Update Resume System Priority**
   - Resume system now prioritizes: implementation_plan/ → high_level_plan.md → ../../archivebin/status.md
   - This ensures clean project structure while maintaining backward compatibility

**DEBUG LOGGING REQUIREMENT**: If debug mode enabled, update ../../project_working_files/debug_log.md with:
- Module 6 completion summary with user interaction details
- Summary of project context assessment results
- **LLD Analysis Summary**: Details of task derivation from all 5 LLD domains
- **Documentation Integration**: How self-referencing documentation was incorporated
- **Gap Analysis Results**: Areas requiring additional research and tools used
- **Research Tool Usage**: All `brave_web_search` and `Context7` queries performed
- **Testing Workflow Integration**: How testing requirements were incorporated
- Plan creation process and decisions made
- Resume system integration verification

## Output Files
- ../../project_working_files/docs/high_level_plan.md (master project roadmap)
- Updated module_resume_system.md (enhanced resume capability)
- Updated status tracking with Module 6 completion

## Next Steps
Upon successful completion of Module 6, proceed to Module 7: Implementation Tracking System. The high_level_plan.md file now serves as the primary project roadmap, and Module 7 will create detailed task-level tracking and progress visualization to guide actual implementation.
