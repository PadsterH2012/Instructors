# Module 3: LLD Structure and Creation (MANDATORY)

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: LLD Scalability Principle

**MANDATORY SCALABILITY REQUIREMENT**:
- **DO NOT artificially limit LLD files to 3 per domain**
- **CREATE AS MANY LLD files as needed for comprehensive coverage**
- **Complex domains (like databases) may require 10+ LLD files**
- **Each LLD file can be up to 800 lines for proper detail**
- **NEVER cram multiple complex topics into a single file to stay under limits**

## CRITICAL: Self-Referencing Documentation Rules

**MANDATORY DOCUMENTATION REFERENCE REQUIREMENT**:
- Agents MUST check `../../project_working_files/docs/documentation/index.md` before making any design decisions
- Agents MUST review other domain LLD index files for consistency with established standards
- Agents MUST use existing documentation as the PRIMARY reference for current system setup
- ALL future decisions MUST be based on documented standards and existing implementations

**PARALLEL DOCUMENTATION CREATION**:
- As each LLD file is created, generate corresponding user/application documentation
- Documentation serves as the authoritative source for all design decisions
- Creates self-building document library that grows with the project

---

## Overview
This module contains directives for setting up modular low-level design structure and creating comprehensive LLD documentation with parallel application documentation. All LLD documents must align with HLD and incorporate research findings while building a self-referencing documentation system.

## Prerequisites
- Module 2 (Documentation Development) must be completed and validated
- All documentation deliverables must exist:
  - project_scope.md
  - project_hld.md
  - techstack.md
- Research Phase deliverables must be available for reference

## Execution Directives

### 3.1 Modular LLD Structure Setup

Execute the following structure setup steps:

1. **Documentation Reference Check (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)**
   - Check if `../../project_working_files/docs/documentation/index.md` exists
   - If exists: Review existing documentation standards and established patterns
   - If not exists: Create initial documentation structure as part of this module
   - Review other domain LLD index files for consistency requirements
   - Use existing documentation as PRIMARY reference for current system setup

2. **Prerequisites Verification**
   - PREREQUISITE: Research Validation Checkpoint must be complete
   - Verify all Module 2 deliverables are complete and validated

3. **LLD Folder Structure Creation**
   - Create modular folder-based LLD structure in ../../project_working_files/working_files/design/ for working files
   - Create separate folders for each LLD domain:
     - ../../project_working_files/working_files/design/db_lld/ - Database-related LLD documents
     - ../../project_working_files/working_files/design/devops_lld/ - DevOps and infrastructure LLD documents
     - ../../project_working_files/working_files/design/uxui_lld/ - UI/UX design LLD documents
     - ../../project_working_files/working_files/design/coding_lld/ - Code architecture LLD documents
     - ../../project_working_files/working_files/design/testing_lld/ - Testing strategy LLD documents

4. **Parallel Documentation Structure Creation**
   - Create corresponding application documentation structure in `../../project_working_files/docs/documentation/`
   - Create domain-specific documentation folders:
     - `../../project_working_files/docs/documentation/database/` - Database user documentation
     - `../../project_working_files/docs/documentation/deployment/` - Deployment and infrastructure guides
     - `../../project_working_files/docs/documentation/frontend/` - UI/UX user guides
     - `../../project_working_files/docs/documentation/backend/` - API and backend documentation
     - `../../project_working_files/docs/documentation/testing/` - Testing guides and procedures

5. **Scalable File Naming Convention**
   - Use numbered files per domain that scale based on complexity
   - Format: `{domain}_lld_01.md`, `{domain}_lld_02.md`, etc. (continue as needed)
   - Size limit: Maximum 800 lines per LLD file (increased for proper coverage)
   - **CRITICAL**: Create as many LLD files as needed per domain - DO NOT artificially limit to 3 files
   - Example: For complex database domains, create:
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_01.md (Core Schema Design)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_02.md (Entity Relationships)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_03.md (Data Models and Validation)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_04.md (Query Optimization - Part 1: Basic Queries)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_05.md (Query Optimization - Part 2: Complex Joins)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_06.md (Query Optimization - Part 3: Stored Procedures)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_07.md (Indexing Strategies)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_08.md (Security Implementation - Part 1: Authentication)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_09.md (Security Implementation - Part 2: Authorization & Encryption)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_10.md (Performance Tuning)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_11.md (Migration Procedures)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_12.md (Backup and Recovery)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_13.md (Scaling and Sharding)
     - ... (continue as needed for comprehensive coverage)
   - **TOPIC SPANNING EXAMPLE**: If "Query Optimization" requires 2000+ lines of detail, split it across multiple files:
     - db_lld_04.md: Query Optimization - Part 1 (Basic queries, simple optimizations)
     - db_lld_05.md: Query Optimization - Part 2 (Complex joins, subqueries)
     - db_lld_06.md: Query Optimization - Part 3 (Stored procedures, functions)

6. **Index File Requirements with Topic Mapping**
   - Create index.md in each domain folder (../../project_working_files/working_files/design/{domain}_lld/index.md)
   - Each index file must list LLD files with their covered topics:
     ```
     /db_lld/db_lld_01.md    {Schema Design, Data Models, Basic CRUD}
     /db_lld/db_lld_02.md    {Query Optimization, Security, Backup}
     ```
   - Include cross-references to related LLD files in other domains
   - Reference research findings that informed each LLD
   - Link to corresponding application documentation

### 3.2 Self-Referencing Documentation Creation

Execute the following documentation creation steps:

1. **Documentation Index Creation (If Not Exists)**
   - Create `../../project_working_files/docs/documentation/index.md` as the master documentation index
   - This file becomes the PRIMARY reference for all future design decisions
   - Include sections for each domain with links to specific documentation
   - Establish documentation standards and patterns for consistency

2. **LLD Creation Prerequisites**
   - PREREQUISITE: Modular LLD Structure Setup must be complete
   - MANDATORY: Check existing documentation before creating new LLD content
   - Ensure all LLDs align with project_hld.md and use validated_tech_stack.md recommendations
   - Each LLD must incorporate relevant findings from the Research Phase deliverables
   - Base decisions on existing documented standards and implementations

3. **Parallel LLD and Application Documentation Creation**
   - For each LLD file created, generate corresponding application documentation
   - LLD files (../../project_working_files/working_files/design/) contain technical implementation details
   - Application docs (../../project_working_files/docs/documentation/) contain user-facing guides and references
   - Both must be created simultaneously to maintain consistency

4. **LLD Development Guidelines**
   - Each LLD file should cover up to 800 lines of focused, related topics
   - **SCALABILITY PRINCIPLE**: Create as many LLD files as needed for comprehensive coverage - DO NOT artificially limit
   - **TOPIC SPANNING PRINCIPLE**: When a single topic requires more than 800 lines, split it across multiple files:
     - Use clear part indicators: "Topic Name - Part 1", "Topic Name - Part 2", etc.
     - Maintain logical flow and cross-references between parts
     - Example: "Security Implementation - Part 1: Authentication", "Security Implementation - Part 2: Authorization"
   - LLDs should complement each other rather than duplicate content
   - Include cross-references to related content in other LLDs and research findings
   - When improvements affect multiple domains, coordinate changes across relevant LLDs
   - Each LLD should include: purpose, scope, dependencies, detailed design, implementation guidelines, integration points, and research references
   - Reference existing documentation as the authoritative source for established patterns
   - **COMPLEXITY-DRIVEN SCALING**: Complex domains (like databases) may require 10+ LLD files for proper coverage

5. **Technology Stack Maintenance**
   - Update techstack.md whenever any LLD is modified:
     - Add any new technologies or components introduced (with research validation)
     - Update version requirements if changed (with compatibility verification)
     - Document new reusable components
     - Ensure consistency between techstack.md, all LLDs, research findings, and application documentation

     /db_lld/db_lld_15.md    {Monitoring and Maintenance Procedures}
     ... (continue listing all created files)
     ```
   - **SPANNING DOCUMENTATION**: When topics span multiple files, clearly indicate the relationship:
     - Use "Part 1", "Part 2", "Part 3" naming for related content
     - Include cross-references between related files
     - Maintain logical flow across the spanning files

   - Create feedback loops where new LLDs reference and build upon existing documentation
   - Implement consistency checks across all documentation domains

### 3.9 Benefits of Consolidated LLD and Self-Referencing Documentation

Document the following benefits:
- **Scalable Structure**: Create as many LLD files as needed (up to 800 lines each) for comprehensive coverage
- **Complexity-Driven Design**: Complex domains can have 10+ LLD files without artificial constraints
- **Focused Content**: Each LLD file covers specific, related topics without cramming
- **Self-Building Library**: Documentation grows automatically and becomes authoritative reference
- **Consistency**: All decisions based on existing documented standards
- **Parallel Documentation**: Technical and user documentation created simultaneously
- **Cross-Domain Integration**: Better coordination between different system aspects
- **Decision Traceability**: Clear reference chain for all design decisions
- **Reduced Duplication**: Single source of truth prevents conflicting information
- **Proper Coverage**: No important details omitted due to artificial file limits

## Validation Checkpoint

Before proceeding to Module 4, verify that all LLD deliverables are complete:

- [ ] All LLD domain folders are created in working_files/design/
- [ ] Consolidated file naming convention is properly implemented ({domain}_lld_01.md format)
- [ ] Index files with topic mapping are created for each LLD domain
- [ ] Documentation structure is created in ../docs/documentation/
- [ ] Master documentation index (../docs/documentation/index.md) is created
- [ ] Database LLD files and parallel documentation are created
- [ ] DevOps LLD files and parallel documentation are created
- [ ] Frontend LLD files and parallel documentation are created
- [ ] Backend LLD files and parallel documentation are created
- [ ] Testing LLD files and parallel documentation are created
- [ ] All LLDs reference research findings appropriately
- [ ] Cross-references between LLD domains are established
- [ ] All LLD files are within 800 line limits and properly scaled for complexity
- [ ] Parallel application documentation exists for each LLD domain
- [ ] Self-referencing documentation system is established
- [ ] techstack.md is updated to reflect LLD structure

**MANDATORY**: If any LLD deliverable is missing or incomplete, repeat the relevant LLD creation steps. All subsequent modules MUST reference and build upon these LLD outputs and use the documentation system as the primary reference.

**GAP IDENTIFICATION REQUIREMENT**: During LLD creation, identify any gaps in technical specifications or missing details. Document these gaps for resolution in Module 4. Major gaps that prevent comprehensive LLD creation MUST be resolved immediately using research tools (`brave_web_search`, `Context7`) before marking Module 3 as complete.

## Output Files
- Consolidated LLD folder structure in working_files/design/
- Numbered LLD files per domain ({domain}_lld_01.md, etc.)
- Domain index files with topic mapping
- Parallel application documentation in ../docs/documentation/
- Master documentation index (../docs/documentation/index.md)
- Self-referencing documentation system

## Next Module
Upon successful completion and validation, proceed to Module 4: Task and Gap Management.
