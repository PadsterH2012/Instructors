# Module 3: LLD Structure and Creation (MANDATORY)

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: LLD Scalability Principle

**MANDATORY SCALABILITY REQUIREMENT**:
- **DO NOT artificially limit LLD files to 3 per domain**
- **CREATE AS MANY LLD files as needed for comprehensive coverage**
- **Complex domains (like databases) may require 10+ LLD files**
- **Each LLD file can be up to 800 lines for proper detail**
- **NEVER cram multiple complex topics into a single file to stay under limits**

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED

**MANDATORY COMPLETION REQUIREMENT**:
- **COMPLETE ALL PLANNED LLD FILES** before proceeding to Module 4
- **DO NOT suggest shortcuts** like "proceed with partial completion"
- **DO NOT move to Module 4** until ALL LLD files in ALL domains are complete
- **USE INCREMENTAL FILE CREATION** to avoid "tool input too large" errors
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: If you plan 19 database LLD files, create all 19 files

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: SPECIFICATION FIDELITY REQUIREMENTS

**MANDATORY IMPLEMENTATION DETAIL REQUIREMENT**:
- **LLDs MUST contain sufficient detail for exact implementation** without agent interpretation
- **SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS** must be defined, not left to agent choice
- **EXACT TECHNOLOGY USAGE PATTERNS** and configurations must be specified
- **ALL COMPONENT INTERFACES** must be completely defined with exact signatures
- **COMPONENT INTERACTION PATTERNS** must be fully specified
- **CODE STRUCTURE GUIDANCE** must be provided for faithful implementation
- **CONFIGURATION SPECIFICATIONS** must be explicit and complete
- **ERROR HANDLING PATTERNS** must be specified for each component
- **DATA STRUCTURES** and their relationships must be completely defined
- **BUSINESS LOGIC IMPLEMENTATION** approaches must be clearly specified

**MANDATORY SPECIFICATION AUTHORITY ESTABLISHMENT**:
- **LLDs ARE DEFINITIVE IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATIONS**, not suggestions
- **ALL IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS** must reference and follow LLD specifications
- **AGENTS MUST FOLLOW SPECIFICATIONS**, not training defaults
- **LLDs MUST BE COMPREHENSIVE** enough to minimize agent interpretation requirements
- **IMPLEMENTATION VALIDATION FRAMEWORK** must be established for validating implementation against LLD specifications

## CRITICAL: Self-Referencing Documentation Rules

**MANDATORY DOCUMENTATION REFERENCE REQUIREMENT**:
- Agents MUST check `../../project_working_files/docs/documentation/index.md` before making any design decisions
- Agents MUST review other domain LLD index files for consistency with established standards
- Agents MUST use existing documentation as the PRIMARY reference for current system setup
- ALL future decisions MUST be based on documented standards and existing implementations

**PARALLEL DOCUMENTATION CREATION**:
- As each LLD file is created, generate corresponding user/application documentation
- Documentation serves as the authoritative source for all design decisions
- Creates self-building document library that grows with the project

---

## Overview
This module contains directives for setting up modular low-level design structure and creating comprehensive LLD documentation with parallel application documentation. All LLD documents must align with HLD and incorporate research findings while building a self-referencing documentation system.

## Prerequisites
- Module 2 (Documentation Development) must be completed and validated
- All documentation deliverables must exist:
  - project_scope.md
  - project_hld.md
  - techstack.md
- Research Phase deliverables must be available for reference

## Execution Directives

### 3.1 Modular LLD Structure Setup

Execute the following structure setup steps:

1. **Documentation Reference Check (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)**
   - Check if `../../project_working_files/docs/documentation/index.md` exists
   - If exists: Review existing documentation standards and established patterns
   - If not exists: Create initial documentation structure as part of this module
   - Review other domain LLD index files for consistency requirements
   - Use existing documentation as PRIMARY reference for current system setup

2. **Prerequisites Verification**
   - PREREQUISITE: Research Validation Checkpoint must be complete
   - Verify all Module 2 deliverables are complete and validated

3. **LLD Folder Structure Creation**
   - Create modular folder-based LLD structure in ../../project_working_files/working_files/design/ for working files
   - Create separate folders for each LLD domain:
     - ../../project_working_files/working_files/design/db_lld/ - Database-related LLD documents
     - ../../project_working_files/working_files/design/devops_lld/ - DevOps and infrastructure LLD documents
     - ../../project_working_files/working_files/design/uxui_lld/ - UI/UX design LLD documents
     - ../../project_working_files/working_files/design/coding_lld/ - Code architecture LLD documents
     - ../../project_working_files/working_files/design/testing_lld/ - Testing strategy LLD documents

4. **Parallel Documentation Structure Creation**
   - Create corresponding application documentation structure in `../../project_working_files/docs/documentation/`
   - Create domain-specific documentation folders:
     - `../../project_working_files/docs/documentation/database/` - Database user documentation
     - `../../project_working_files/docs/documentation/deployment/` - Deployment and infrastructure guides
     - `../../project_working_files/docs/documentation/frontend/` - UI/UX user guides
     - `../../project_working_files/docs/documentation/backend/` - API and backend documentation
     - `../../project_working_files/docs/documentation/testing/` - Testing guides and procedures

5. **Scalable File Naming Convention**
   - Use numbered files per domain that scale based on complexity
   - Format: `{domain}_lld_01.md`, `{domain}_lld_02.md`, etc. (continue as needed)
   - Size limit: Maximum 800 lines per LLD file (increased for proper coverage)
   - **CRITICAL**: Create as many LLD files as needed per domain - DO NOT artificially limit to 3 files
   - Example: For complex database domains, create:
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_01.md (Core Schema Design)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_02.md (Entity Relationships)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_03.md (Data Models and Validation)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_04.md (Query Optimization - Part 1: Basic Queries)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_05.md (Query Optimization - Part 2: Complex Joins)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_06.md (Query Optimization - Part 3: Stored Procedures)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_07.md (Indexing Strategies)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_08.md (Security Implementation - Part 1: Authentication)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_09.md (Security Implementation - Part 2: Authorization & Encryption)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_10.md (Performance Tuning)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_11.md (Migration Procedures)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_12.md (Backup and Recovery)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_13.md (Scaling and Sharding)
     - ... (continue as needed for comprehensive coverage)
   - **TOPIC SPANNING EXAMPLE**: If "Query Optimization" requires 2000+ lines of detail, split it across multiple files:
     - db_lld_04.md: Query Optimization - Part 1 (Basic queries, simple optimizations)
     - db_lld_05.md: Query Optimization - Part 2 (Complex joins, subqueries)
     - db_lld_06.md: Query Optimization - Part 3 (Stored procedures, functions)

6. **Index File Requirements with Topic Mapping**
   - Create index.md in each domain folder (../../project_working_files/working_files/design/{domain}_lld/index.md)
   - Each index file must list LLD files with their covered topics:
     ```
     /db_lld/db_lld_01.md    {Schema Design, Data Models, Basic CRUD}
     /db_lld/db_lld_02.md    {Query Optimization, Security, Backup}
     ```
   - Include cross-references to related LLD files in other domains
   - Reference research findings that informed each LLD
   - Link to corresponding application documentation

### 3.2 Self-Referencing Documentation Creation

Execute the following documentation creation steps:

1. **Documentation Index Creation (If Not Exists)**
   - Create `../../project_working_files/docs/documentation/index.md` as the master documentation index
   - This file becomes the PRIMARY reference for all future design decisions
   - Include sections for each domain with links to specific documentation
   - Establish documentation standards and patterns for consistency

2. **LLD Creation Prerequisites**
   - PREREQUISITE: Modular LLD Structure Setup must be complete
   - MANDATORY: Check existing documentation before creating new LLD content
   - Ensure all LLDs align with project_hld.md and use validated_tech_stack.md recommendations
   - Each LLD must incorporate relevant findings from the Research Phase deliverables
   - Base decisions on existing documented standards and implementations

3. **ðŸš¨ MANDATORY: Parallel LLD and Logical Documentation Creation**
   - **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: As LLD files are created, you MUST simultaneously develop comprehensive user documentation
   - **LOGICAL HIERARCHY APPROACH**: Organize documentation by user needs and journeys, not by LLD file structure
   - **TOPIC-DRIVEN ORGANIZATION**: Group documentation by logical user tasks (setup, usage, administration, reference)
   - **SCALABLE FILE STRUCTURE**: Split documentation files when content exceeds 1000-1500 lines for readability
   - **USER-FOCUSED SPLITTING**: Split by user tasks and workflows, not technical boundaries
   - LLD files (../../project_working_files/working_files/design/) contain technical implementation details
   - Application docs (../../project_working_files/docs/documentation/) contain user-facing guides organized by logical hierarchy
   - **VALIDATION REQUIREMENT**: Ensure comprehensive user documentation coverage exists for all LLD technical content

4. **LLD Development Guidelines with Documentation Validation**
   - Each LLD file should cover up to 800 lines of focused, related topics
   - **TOPIC-DRIVEN APPROACH**: Focus on coverage areas, not pre-assigned file numbers
   - **DYNAMIC FILE CREATION**: Create files based on actual content size, don't pre-assign topics to specific file numbers
   - **SCALABILITY PRINCIPLE**: Create as many LLD files as needed for comprehensive coverage - DO NOT artificially limit
   - **TOPIC SPANNING PRINCIPLE**: When a single topic requires more than 800 lines, split it across multiple files:
     - Use clear part indicators: "Topic Name - Part 1", "Topic Name - Part 2", etc.
     - Maintain logical flow and cross-references between parts
     - Example: "Security Implementation - Part 1: Authentication", "Security Implementation - Part 2: Authorization"
   - **ðŸš¨ MANDATORY LLD STRUCTURE**: Each LLD file MUST include these sections:
     - Purpose and Scope
     - Technical Implementation Details
     - Integration Points and Dependencies
     - **ðŸ“‹ Documentation Coverage Verification** (see template below)
     - **ðŸ”— User Documentation Requirements** (see template below)
   - **COVERAGE COMPLETION**: Ensure ALL required coverage areas are documented, regardless of file count
   - **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED**: Do not suggest "partial completion" or "proceed with subset of coverage areas"
   - **INCREMENTAL CREATION REQUIRED**: Use save-file (max 300 lines) + str-replace-editor (max 200 lines) to avoid input size errors
   - **CONTENT-DRIVEN SPLITTING**: If a file exceeds 800 lines, split it logically rather than cramming content
   - LLDs should complement each other rather than duplicate content
   - Include cross-references to related content in other LLDs and research findings
   - When improvements affect multiple domains, coordinate changes across relevant LLDs
   - Each LLD should include: purpose, scope, dependencies, detailed design, implementation guidelines, integration points, and research references
   - Reference existing documentation as the authoritative source for established patterns
   - **COMPLEXITY-DRIVEN SCALING**: Complex domains (like databases) may require 10+ LLD files for proper coverage

5. **ðŸš¨ MANDATORY: LLD Documentation Validation Template**

Each LLD file MUST include these sections at the end:

```markdown
## ðŸ“‹ Documentation Coverage Verification

### Required User Documentation for This LLD:
- [ ] **Setup Documentation**: [Specific setup guides needed]
- [ ] **Usage Documentation**: [Specific usage guides needed]
- [ ] **Administration Documentation**: [Specific admin guides needed]
- [ ] **Reference Documentation**: [Specific reference docs needed]

### Documentation File Verification:
- [ ] `../docs/documentation/{domain}/setup/{specific_file}.md` - EXISTS/MISSING

- [ ] `../docs/documentation/{domain}/administration/{specific_file}.md` - EXISTS/MISSING
- [ ] `../docs/documentation/{domain}/reference/{specific_file}.md` - EXISTS/MISSING

### ðŸš¨ MANDATORY ACTION REQUIRED:
**BEFORE PROCEEDING TO NEXT LLD**: If any documentation files are marked as MISSING, you MUST:
1. Create the missing documentation files immediately
2. Ensure they contain comprehensive user-friendly content covering this LLD's technical details
3. Update this verification section to mark files as EXISTS
4. Only then proceed to create the next LLD file

## ðŸ”— User Documentation Requirements

### Content Requirements for Each Documentation File:
- **Setup Documentation**: Step-by-step installation/configuration procedures
- **Usage Documentation**: User-friendly guides with examples and screenshots
- **Administration Documentation**: Maintenance procedures, troubleshooting guides
- **Reference Documentation**: Complete technical references, API docs, configuration options

### Quality Standards:
- Written for end users, not developers
- Include practical examples and code snippets
- Provide troubleshooting sections
- Cross-reference related documentation
- Maximum 1000-1500 lines per file (split if larger)
```

6. **Technology Stack Maintenance**
   - Update techstack.md whenever any LLD is modified:
     - Add any new technologies or components introduced (with research validation)
     - Update version requirements if changed (with compatibility verification)
     - Document new reusable components
     - Ensure consistency between techstack.md, all LLDs, research findings, and application documentation

### 3.3 Database LLD Creation

Execute the following database LLD steps:

1. **Documentation Reference Check**
   - Check existing documentation in `../docs/documentation/database/` for established patterns
   - Review other domain LLD index files for consistency with database design decisions
   - Use existing documentation as primary reference for current database setup

2. **Scalable Database LLD Structure**
   - Create numbered LLD files in working_files/design/db_lld/ based on project complexity:
   - **CRITICAL**: Create as many files as needed - DO NOT limit to 3 files
   - **MANDATORY COMPLETION**: If you plan N database LLD files, you MUST create ALL N files before proceeding
   - **NO PARTIAL COMPLETION**: Do not suggest moving to Module 4 with incomplete database LLD coverage
   - **Minimum Structure** (simple projects):
     - db_lld_01.md: Core schema design and basic models (up to 800 lines)
     - db_lld_02.md: Query optimization and performance (up to 800 lines)
     - db_lld_03.md: Security and backup procedures (up to 800 lines)
   - **TOPIC-DRIVEN APPROACH** (complex projects - CREATE AS MANY FILES AS NEEDED):

   **REQUIRED COVERAGE AREAS** (create LLD files dynamically based on content size):
   - **Core Database Design**: Schema design, table structures, entity relationships, foreign key constraints
   - **Data Models and Validation**: Data models, validation rules, business logic constraints
   - **Indexing Strategies**: Basic indexing, advanced indexing, composite indexes, performance optimization
   - **Query Optimization**: Basic queries, complex joins, subqueries, stored procedures, functions
   - **Security Implementation**: Authentication, authorization, role-based access, encryption, data protection
   - **Performance and Scaling**: Performance tuning, scaling strategies, sharding approaches, load balancing
   - **Backup and Recovery**: Backup procedures, disaster recovery, data archival, restoration processes
   - **Migration and Versioning**: Database migrations, schema versioning, upgrade procedures
   - **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Performance monitoring, health checks, maintenance procedures, troubleshooting
   - **Multi-Database Coordination**: (if applicable) Cross-database synchronization, data consistency, transaction management

   **DYNAMIC FILE CREATION PROCESS WITH DOCUMENTATION VALIDATION**:
   1. Start with first topic area and create db_lld_01.md
   2. **MANDATORY**: Include Documentation Coverage Verification section in db_lld_01.md
   3. **MANDATORY**: Check for required documentation files and create if MISSING
   4. **MANDATORY**: Update verification section to mark files as EXISTS
   5. If content exceeds 800 lines, split into db_lld_01.md and db_lld_02.md
   6. Move to next topic area and create db_lld_03.md (or continue numbering)
   7. **REPEAT VALIDATION**: Include Documentation Coverage Verification in each new LLD file
   8. **ENFORCE CREATION**: Create missing documentation before proceeding to next LLD
   9. Split large topics across multiple files with clear part indicators
   10. Continue until ALL required coverage areas are comprehensively documented

   **TOPIC SPANNING PRINCIPLE**: When a single topic requires more than 800 lines, split it into logical parts across multiple numbered files with clear part indicators (e.g., "Query Optimization - Part 1", "Query Optimization - Part 2")

3. **ðŸš¨ MANDATORY: Logical Database Documentation Creation**
   - **CRITICAL**: As database LLD files are created, simultaneously develop comprehensive user documentation in `../docs/documentation/database/`
   - **LOGICAL HIERARCHY STRUCTURE**: Organize documentation by user journey and tasks:
     ```

2. Add Documentation Coverage Verification section:
   - [ ] setup/schema_installation.md - MISSING
   - [ ] usage/basic_database_operations.md - MISSING
   - [ ] reference/schema_reference.md - MISSING
3. STOP: Create the 3 missing documentation files
4. Update verification section:
   - [x] setup/schema_installation.md - EXISTS
   - [x] usage/basic_database_operations.md - EXISTS
   - [x] reference/schema_reference.md - EXISTS
5. NOW proceed to create db_lld_02.md
6. Repeat validation process for db_lld_02.md
```

4. **Database LLD Index with Dynamic Topic Mapping**
   - Create working_files/design/db_lld/index.md with comprehensive topic mapping
   - **CRITICAL**: List ALL created LLD files based on actual content coverage
   - **DYNAMIC APPROACH**: Update index as files are created, don't pre-assign numbers

   **COVERAGE VERIFICATION**: Ensure all required areas are documented:

     ```
   - Include cross-references to related LLD files in other domains
   - Link to corresponding application documentation in ../docs/documentation/testing/

### 3.8 Documentation Index Creation

Execute the following documentation index creation steps:

1. **Master Documentation Index Creation**
   - Create `../docs/documentation/index.md` as the authoritative documentation reference
   - Include links to all domain-specific documentation folders
   - Establish this as the PRIMARY reference for all future design decisions
   - Create cross-references between different documentation domains

2. **Self-Referencing System Implementation**
   - Ensure all future agents check this documentation index before making decisions
   - Establish documentation as the single source of truth for system design
   - Create feedback loops where new LLDs reference and build upon existing documentation
   - Implement consistency checks across all documentation domains

### 3.9 Benefits of Consolidated LLD and Self-Referencing Documentation

Document the following benefits:
- **Scalable Structure**: Create as many LLD files as needed (up to 800 lines each) for comprehensive coverage
- **Complexity-Driven Design**: Complex domains can have 10+ LLD files without artificial constraints
- **Focused Content**: Each LLD file covers specific, related topics without cramming
- **Self-Building Library**: Documentation grows automatically and becomes authoritative reference
- **Consistency**: All decisions based on existing documented standards
- **Parallel Documentation**: Technical and user documentation created simultaneously
- **Cross-Domain Integration**: Better coordination between different system aspects
- **Decision Traceability**: Clear reference chain for all design decisions
- **Reduced Duplication**: Single source of truth prevents conflicting information
- **Proper Coverage**: No important details omitted due to artificial file limits

### 3.10 Module Completion and Git Integration

Execute the following module completion steps:

1. **Update Module 3 Status to COMPLETED**
   - Update ../../project_working_files/status.md to mark Module 3 as COMPLETED
   - Add timestamp and completion notes
   - Add entry to the Status Update History section

2. **Git Commit for Module 3 Completion**
   - **PRE-COMMIT VALIDATION**: Verify all module deliverables are complete and in correct locations
   - **CHECK STATUS**: Run `git status` to review all changes made during Module 3
   - **STAGE FILES**: Add all relevant files created during Module 3 (respecting .gitignore)
   - **COMMIT**: Create commit with message:
     ```
     "Complete Module 3: LLD Structure and Creation - Comprehensive design documentation

     - Database LLD files created with comprehensive coverage areas
     - DevOps LLD files completed with infrastructure specifications

     - Master documentation index established

     Module Status: COMPLETED
     Next Module: Module 4 - Task and Gap Management"
     ```
   - **PUSH**: Push committed changes to remote repository
   - **VALIDATE**: Confirm git repository is clean and synchronized

## Validation Checkpoint

Before proceeding to Module 4, verify that all LLD deliverables are complete:

- [ ] All LLD domain folders are created in working_files/design/
- [ ] Consolidated file naming convention is properly implemented ({domain}_lld_01.md format)
- [ ] Index files with topic mapping are created for each LLD domain
- [ ] Documentation structure is created in ../docs/documentation/
- [ ] Master documentation index (../docs/documentation/index.md) is created
- [ ] Database LLD files and parallel documentation are created
- [ ] DevOps LLD files and parallel documentation are created
- [ ] Frontend LLD files and parallel documentation are created
- [ ] Backend LLD files and parallel documentation are created
- [ ] Testing LLD files and parallel documentation are created
- [ ] All LLDs reference research findings appropriately
- [ ] Cross-references between LLD domains are established
- [ ] All LLD files are within 800 line limits and properly scaled for complexity
- [ ] **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL**: Comprehensive user documentation exists covering all LLD technical content
- [ ] **LOGICAL HIERARCHY**: User documentation is organized by user journey and logical tasks
- [ ] **COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE**: All LLD technical content has corresponding user-friendly documentation
- [ ] **PROPER STRUCTURE**: Documentation follows logical hierarchy (setup/, usage/, administration/, reference/)
- [ ] Self-referencing documentation system is established
- [ ] techstack.md is updated to reflect LLD structure
- [ ] Git commit for Module 3 completion has been created and pushed
- [ ] Git repository shows clean status with no uncommitted changes
- [ ] Remote repository is synchronized with local Module 3 completion

**MANDATORY**: If any LLD deliverable is missing or incomplete, repeat the relevant LLD creation steps. All subsequent modules MUST reference and build upon these LLD outputs and use the documentation system as the primary reference.

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL COMPLETION ENFORCEMENT**:
- **VERIFY ALL COVERAGE AREAS ARE DOCUMENTED**: Check that every required coverage area has comprehensive documentation
- **NO PARTIAL COVERAGE ALLOWED**: All required coverage areas must be fully documented across however many files needed
- **NO SHORTCUTS TO MODULE 4**: Module 3 is NOT complete until every coverage area is comprehensively documented
- **USE INCREMENTAL CREATION**: If hitting "tool input too large" errors, use save-file + str-replace-editor approach
- **CONTENT-DRIVEN FILE COUNT**: File count should be determined by content needs, not pre-assigned numbers
- **MANDATORY COVERAGE RECHECK**: Before marking Module 3 complete, verify every required coverage area is comprehensively documented
- **ðŸš¨ DOCUMENTATION VALIDATION ENFORCEMENT**: Every LLD file MUST have completed Documentation Coverage Verification section
- **NO MISSING DOCUMENTATION**: All LLD files must show "EXISTS" for all required documentation files
- **VALIDATION SECTION REQUIRED**: Each LLD must include the mandatory Documentation Coverage Verification template

**GAP IDENTIFICATION REQUIREMENT**: During LLD creation, identify any gaps in technical specifications or missing details. Document these gaps for resolution in Module 4. Major gaps that prevent comprehensive LLD creation MUST be resolved immediately using research tools (`brave_web_search`, `Context7`) before marking Module 3 as complete.

## Output Files
- Consolidated LLD folder structure in working_files/design/
- Numbered LLD files per domain ({domain}_lld_01.md, etc.)
- Domain index files with topic mapping
- Parallel application documentation in ../docs/documentation/
- Master documentation index (../docs/documentation/index.md)
- Self-referencing documentation system
