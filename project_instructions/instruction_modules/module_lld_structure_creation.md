# Module 3: LLD Structure and Creation (MANDATORY)

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: LLD Scalability Principle

**MANDATORY SCALABILITY REQUIREMENT**:
- **DO NOT artificially limit LLD files to 3 per domain**
- **CREATE AS MANY LLD files as needed for comprehensive coverage**
- **Complex domains (like databases) may require 10+ LLD files**
- **Each LLD file can be up to 800 lines for proper detail**
- **NEVER cram multiple complex topics into a single file to stay under limits**

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED

**MANDATORY COMPLETION REQUIREMENT**:
- **COMPLETE ALL PLANNED LLD FILES** before proceeding to Module 4
- **DO NOT suggest shortcuts** like "proceed with partial completion"
- **DO NOT move to Module 4** until ALL LLD files in ALL domains are complete
- **USE INCREMENTAL FILE CREATION** to avoid "tool input too large" errors
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: If you plan 19 database LLD files, create all 19 files

## CRITICAL: Self-Referencing Documentation Rules

**MANDATORY DOCUMENTATION REFERENCE REQUIREMENT**:
- Agents MUST check `../../project_working_files/docs/documentation/index.md` before making any design decisions
- Agents MUST review other domain LLD index files for consistency with established standards
- Agents MUST use existing documentation as the PRIMARY reference for current system setup
- ALL future decisions MUST be based on documented standards and existing implementations

**PARALLEL DOCUMENTATION CREATION**:
- As each LLD file is created, generate corresponding user/application documentation
- Documentation serves as the authoritative source for all design decisions
- Creates self-building document library that grows with the project

---

## Overview
This module contains directives for setting up modular low-level design structure and creating comprehensive LLD documentation with parallel application documentation. All LLD documents must align with HLD and incorporate research findings while building a self-referencing documentation system.

## Prerequisites
- Module 2 (Documentation Development) must be completed and validated
- All documentation deliverables must exist:
  - project_scope.md
  - project_hld.md
  - techstack.md
- Research Phase deliverables must be available for reference

## Execution Directives

### 3.1 Modular LLD Structure Setup

Execute the following structure setup steps:

1. **Documentation Reference Check (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)**
   - Check if `../../project_working_files/docs/documentation/index.md` exists
   - If exists: Review existing documentation standards and established patterns
   - If not exists: Create initial documentation structure as part of this module
   - Review other domain LLD index files for consistency requirements
   - Use existing documentation as PRIMARY reference for current system setup

2. **Prerequisites Verification**
   - PREREQUISITE: Research Validation Checkpoint must be complete
   - Verify all Module 2 deliverables are complete and validated

3. **LLD Folder Structure Creation**
   - Create modular folder-based LLD structure in ../../project_working_files/working_files/design/ for working files
   - Create separate folders for each LLD domain:
     - ../../project_working_files/working_files/design/db_lld/ - Database-related LLD documents
     - ../../project_working_files/working_files/design/devops_lld/ - DevOps and infrastructure LLD documents
     - ../../project_working_files/working_files/design/uxui_lld/ - UI/UX design LLD documents
     - ../../project_working_files/working_files/design/coding_lld/ - Code architecture LLD documents
     - ../../project_working_files/working_files/design/testing_lld/ - Testing strategy LLD documents

4. **Parallel Documentation Structure Creation**
   - Create corresponding application documentation structure in `../../project_working_files/docs/documentation/`
   - Create domain-specific documentation folders:
     - `../../project_working_files/docs/documentation/database/` - Database user documentation
     - `../../project_working_files/docs/documentation/deployment/` - Deployment and infrastructure guides
     - `../../project_working_files/docs/documentation/frontend/` - UI/UX user guides
     - `../../project_working_files/docs/documentation/backend/` - API and backend documentation
     - `../../project_working_files/docs/documentation/testing/` - Testing guides and procedures

5. **Scalable File Naming Convention**
   - Use numbered files per domain that scale based on complexity
   - Format: `{domain}_lld_01.md`, `{domain}_lld_02.md`, etc. (continue as needed)
   - Size limit: Maximum 800 lines per LLD file (increased for proper coverage)
   - **CRITICAL**: Create as many LLD files as needed per domain - DO NOT artificially limit to 3 files
   - Example: For complex database domains, create:
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_01.md (Core Schema Design)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_02.md (Entity Relationships)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_03.md (Data Models and Validation)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_04.md (Query Optimization - Part 1: Basic Queries)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_05.md (Query Optimization - Part 2: Complex Joins)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_06.md (Query Optimization - Part 3: Stored Procedures)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_07.md (Indexing Strategies)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_08.md (Security Implementation - Part 1: Authentication)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_09.md (Security Implementation - Part 2: Authorization & Encryption)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_10.md (Performance Tuning)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_11.md (Migration Procedures)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_12.md (Backup and Recovery)
     - working_files/design/db_lld/db_lld_13.md (Scaling and Sharding)
     - ... (continue as needed for comprehensive coverage)
   - **TOPIC SPANNING EXAMPLE**: If "Query Optimization" requires 2000+ lines of detail, split it across multiple files:
     - db_lld_04.md: Query Optimization - Part 1 (Basic queries, simple optimizations)
     - db_lld_05.md: Query Optimization - Part 2 (Complex joins, subqueries)
     - db_lld_06.md: Query Optimization - Part 3 (Stored procedures, functions)

6. **Index File Requirements with Topic Mapping**
   - Create index.md in each domain folder (../../project_working_files/working_files/design/{domain}_lld/index.md)
   - Each index file must list LLD files with their covered topics:
     ```
     /db_lld/db_lld_01.md    {Schema Design, Data Models, Basic CRUD}
     /db_lld/db_lld_02.md    {Query Optimization, Security, Backup}
     ```
   - Include cross-references to related LLD files in other domains
   - Reference research findings that informed each LLD
   - Link to corresponding application documentation

### 3.2 Self-Referencing Documentation Creation

Execute the following documentation creation steps:

1. **Documentation Index Creation (If Not Exists)**
   - Create `../../project_working_files/docs/documentation/index.md` as the master documentation index
   - This file becomes the PRIMARY reference for all future design decisions
   - Include sections for each domain with links to specific documentation
   - Establish documentation standards and patterns for consistency

2. **LLD Creation Prerequisites**
   - PREREQUISITE: Modular LLD Structure Setup must be complete
   - MANDATORY: Check existing documentation before creating new LLD content
   - Ensure all LLDs align with project_hld.md and use validated_tech_stack.md recommendations
   - Each LLD must incorporate relevant findings from the Research Phase deliverables
   - Base decisions on existing documented standards and implementations

3. **Parallel LLD and Application Documentation Creation**
   - For each LLD file created, generate corresponding application documentation
   - LLD files (../../project_working_files/working_files/design/) contain technical implementation details
   - Application docs (../../project_working_files/docs/documentation/) contain user-facing guides and references
   - Both must be created simultaneously to maintain consistency

4. **LLD Development Guidelines**
   - Each LLD file should cover up to 800 lines of focused, related topics
   - **TOPIC-DRIVEN APPROACH**: Focus on coverage areas, not pre-assigned file numbers
   - **DYNAMIC FILE CREATION**: Create files based on actual content size, don't pre-assign topics to specific file numbers
   - **SCALABILITY PRINCIPLE**: Create as many LLD files as needed for comprehensive coverage - DO NOT artificially limit
   - **TOPIC SPANNING PRINCIPLE**: When a single topic requires more than 800 lines, split it across multiple files:
     - Use clear part indicators: "Topic Name - Part 1", "Topic Name - Part 2", etc.
     - Maintain logical flow and cross-references between parts
     - Example: "Security Implementation - Part 1: Authentication", "Security Implementation - Part 2: Authorization"
   - **COVERAGE COMPLETION**: Ensure ALL required coverage areas are documented, regardless of file count
   - **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED**: Do not suggest "partial completion" or "proceed with subset of coverage areas"
   - **INCREMENTAL CREATION REQUIRED**: Use save-file (max 300 lines) + str-replace-editor (max 200 lines) to avoid input size errors
   - **CONTENT-DRIVEN SPLITTING**: If a file exceeds 800 lines, split it logically rather than cramming content
   - LLDs should complement each other rather than duplicate content
   - Include cross-references to related content in other LLDs and research findings
   - When improvements affect multiple domains, coordinate changes across relevant LLDs
   - Each LLD should include: purpose, scope, dependencies, detailed design, implementation guidelines, integration points, and research references
   - Reference existing documentation as the authoritative source for established patterns
   - **COMPLEXITY-DRIVEN SCALING**: Complex domains (like databases) may require 10+ LLD files for proper coverage

5. **Technology Stack Maintenance**
   - Update techstack.md whenever any LLD is modified:
     - Add any new technologies or components introduced (with research validation)
     - Update version requirements if changed (with compatibility verification)
     - Document new reusable components
     - Ensure consistency between techstack.md, all LLDs, research findings, and application documentation

### 3.3 Database LLD Creation

1. **Documentation Reference Check**
   - Check existing documentation in `../docs/documentation/database/` for established patterns
   - Review other domain LLD index files for consistency with database design decisions
   - Use existing documentation as primary reference for current database setup

2. **Scalable Database LLD Structure**
   - Create numbered LLD files in working_files/design/db_lld/ based on project complexity:
   - **CRITICAL**: Create as many files as needed - DO NOT limit to 3 files
   - **MANDATORY COMPLETION**: If you plan N database LLD files, you MUST create ALL N files before proceeding
   - **NO PARTIAL COMPLETION**: Do not suggest moving to Module 4 with incomplete database LLD coverage
   - **Minimum Structure** (simple projects):
     - db_lld_01.md: Core schema design and basic models (up to 800 lines)
     - db_lld_02.md: Query optimization and performance (up to 800 lines)
     - db_lld_03.md: Security and backup procedures (up to 800 lines)
   - **TOPIC-DRIVEN APPROACH** (complex projects - CREATE AS MANY FILES AS NEEDED):

   **REQUIRED COVERAGE AREAS** (create LLD files dynamically based on content size):
   - **Core Database Design**: Schema design, table structures, entity relationships, foreign key constraints
   - **Data Models and Validation**: Data models, validation rules, business logic constraints
   - **Indexing Strategies**: Basic indexing, advanced indexing, composite indexes, performance optimization
   - **Query Optimization**: Basic queries, complex joins, subqueries, stored procedures, functions
   - **Security Implementation**: Authentication, authorization, role-based access, encryption, data protection
   - **Performance and Scaling**: Performance tuning, scaling strategies, sharding approaches, load balancing
   - **Backup and Recovery**: Backup procedures, disaster recovery, data archival, restoration processes
   - **Migration and Versioning**: Database migrations, schema versioning, upgrade procedures
   - **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Performance monitoring, health checks, maintenance procedures, troubleshooting
   - **Multi-Database Coordination**: (if applicable) Cross-database synchronization, data consistency, transaction management

   **DYNAMIC FILE CREATION PROCESS**:
   1. Start with first topic area and create db_lld_01.md
   2. If content exceeds 800 lines, split into db_lld_01.md and db_lld_02.md
   3. Move to next topic area and continue numbering (db_lld_03.md, etc.)
   4. Split large topics across multiple files with clear part indicators
   5. Continue until ALL required coverage areas are comprehensively documented

   **TOPIC SPANNING PRINCIPLE**: When a single topic requires more than 800 lines, split it into logical parts across multiple numbered files with clear part indicators (e.g., "Query Optimization - Part 1", "Query Optimization - Part 2")

3. **Parallel Database Documentation Creation**
   - For each LLD file, create corresponding user documentation in `../docs/documentation/database/`:
     - Database setup guides
     - User query examples
     - Data management procedures
     - Troubleshooting guides

4. **Database LLD Index with Dynamic Topic Mapping**
   - Create working_files/design/db_lld/index.md with comprehensive topic mapping
   - **CRITICAL**: List ALL created LLD files based on actual content coverage
   - **DYNAMIC APPROACH**: Update index as files are created, don't pre-assign numbers

   **COVERAGE VERIFICATION**: Ensure all required areas are documented:
   - [ ] Core Database Design (schema, tables, relationships, constraints)
   - [ ] Data Models and Validation (models, validation rules, business logic)
   - [ ] Indexing Strategies (basic, advanced, composite, performance)
   - [ ] Query Optimization (basic queries, joins, subqueries, procedures)
   - [ ] Security Implementation (authentication, authorization, encryption)
   - [ ] Performance and Scaling (tuning, scaling, sharding, load balancing)
   - [ ] Backup and Recovery (procedures, disaster recovery, archival)
   - [ ] Migration and Versioning (migrations, schema versioning, upgrades)
   - [ ] Monitoring and Maintenance (monitoring, health checks, troubleshooting)
   - [ ] Multi-Database Coordination (if applicable - synchronization, consistency)

   **EXAMPLE INDEX STRUCTURE** (actual files will vary based on content):
     ```
     # Database LLD Index

     ## Coverage Areas and Files
     /db_lld/db_lld_01.md    {Core Schema Design - User Tables}
     /db_lld/db_lld_02.md    {Core Schema Design - Game Tables}

     /db_lld/db_lld_06.md    {Indexing Strategies - Part 2: Advanced Patterns}
     ... (continue based on actual content created)

     ## Coverage Verification
     âœ… Core Database Design: Files 01-03
     âœ… Data Models: File 04
     âœ… Indexing: Files 05-06
     ... (update as files are created)
     ```

   - **SPANNING DOCUMENTATION**: When topics span multiple files, clearly indicate the relationship
   - Include cross-references to related LLD files in other domains
   - Link to corresponding application documentation in ../docs/documentation/database/

   - Establish documentation as the single source of truth for system design
   - Create feedback loops where new LLDs reference and build upon existing documentation
   - Implement consistency checks across all documentation domains

### 3.9 Benefits of Consolidated LLD and Self-Referencing Documentation

Document the following benefits:
- **Scalable Structure**: Create as many LLD files as needed (up to 800 lines each) for comprehensive coverage
- **Complexity-Driven Design**: Complex domains can have 10+ LLD files without artificial constraints
- **Focused Content**: Each LLD file covers specific, related topics without cramming
- **Self-Building Library**: Documentation grows automatically and becomes authoritative reference
- **Consistency**: All decisions based on existing documented standards
- **Parallel Documentation**: Technical and user documentation created simultaneously
- **Cross-Domain Integration**: Better coordination between different system aspects
- **Decision Traceability**: Clear reference chain for all design decisions
- **Reduced Duplication**: Single source of truth prevents conflicting information
- **Proper Coverage**: No important details omitted due to artificial file limits

## Validation Checkpoint

Before proceeding to Module 4, verify that all LLD deliverables are complete:

- [ ] All LLD domain folders are created in working_files/design/
- [ ] Consolidated file naming convention is properly implemented ({domain}_lld_01.md format)
- [ ] Index files with topic mapping are created for each LLD domain
- [ ] Documentation structure is created in ../docs/documentation/
- [ ] Master documentation index (../docs/documentation/index.md) is created
- [ ] Database LLD files and parallel documentation are created
- [ ] DevOps LLD files and parallel documentation are created
- [ ] Frontend LLD files and parallel documentation are created
- [ ] Backend LLD files and parallel documentation are created
- [ ] Testing LLD files and parallel documentation are created
- [ ] All LLDs reference research findings appropriately
- [ ] Cross-references between LLD domains are established
- [ ] All LLD files are within 800 line limits and properly scaled for complexity
- [ ] Parallel application documentation exists for each LLD domain
- [ ] Self-referencing documentation system is established
- [ ] techstack.md is updated to reflect LLD structure

**MANDATORY**: If any LLD deliverable is missing or incomplete, repeat the relevant LLD creation steps. All subsequent modules MUST reference and build upon these LLD outputs and use the documentation system as the primary reference.

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL COMPLETION ENFORCEMENT**:
- **VERIFY ALL COVERAGE AREAS ARE DOCUMENTED**: Check that every required coverage area has comprehensive documentation
- **NO PARTIAL COVERAGE ALLOWED**: All required coverage areas must be fully documented across however many files needed
- **NO SHORTCUTS TO MODULE 4**: Module 3 is NOT complete until every coverage area is comprehensively documented
- **USE INCREMENTAL CREATION**: If hitting "tool input too large" errors, use save-file + str-replace-editor approach
- **CONTENT-DRIVEN FILE COUNT**: File count should be determined by content needs, not pre-assigned numbers
- **MANDATORY COVERAGE RECHECK**: Before marking Module 3 complete, verify every required coverage area is comprehensively documented

**GAP IDENTIFICATION REQUIREMENT**: During LLD creation, identify any gaps in technical specifications or missing details. Document these gaps for resolution in Module 4. Major gaps that prevent comprehensive LLD creation MUST be resolved immediately using research tools (`brave_web_search`, `Context7`) before marking Module 3 as complete.

## Output Files
- Consolidated LLD folder structure in working_files/design/
- Numbered LLD files per domain ({domain}_lld_01.md, etc.)
- Domain index files with topic mapping
- Parallel application documentation in ../docs/documentation/
- Master documentation index (../docs/documentation/index.md)
- Self-referencing documentation system

## Next Module

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Module 3 Completion Verification Required**

Before proceeding to Module 4, you MUST verify:
- **ALL COVERAGE AREAS ARE DOCUMENTED**: Every required coverage area has comprehensive documentation
- **NO MISSING COVERAGE**: All required topics are fully documented across however many files needed
- **PROPER FILE SIZES**: Each LLD file should be 600-800 lines with comprehensive coverage (split if larger)
- **NO SHORTCUTS TAKEN**: Do not proceed with "partial coverage" or "subset of required areas"

**MANDATORY COVERAGE VERIFICATION**:
1. **Database Domain**: Verify ALL required coverage areas are comprehensively documented:
   - [ ] Core Database Design (schema, tables, relationships, constraints)
   - [ ] Data Models and Validation (models, validation rules, business logic)
   - [ ] Indexing Strategies (basic, advanced, composite, performance)
   - [ ] Query Optimization (basic queries, joins, subqueries, procedures)
   - [ ] Security Implementation (authentication, authorization, encryption)
   - [ ] Performance and Scaling (tuning, scaling, sharding, load balancing)
   - [ ] Backup and Recovery (procedures, disaster recovery, archival)
   - [ ] Migration and Versioning (migrations, schema versioning, upgrades)
   - [ ] Monitoring and Maintenance (monitoring, health checks, troubleshooting)
   - [ ] Multi-Database Coordination (if applicable)

2. **DevOps Domain**: Verify ALL required coverage areas are documented
3. **Frontend Domain**: Verify ALL required coverage areas are documented
4. **Backend Domain**: Verify ALL required coverage areas are documented
5. **Testing Domain**: Verify ALL required coverage areas are documented

**ONLY AFTER 100% LLD COMPLETION**: Proceed to Module 4: Task and Gap Management.
