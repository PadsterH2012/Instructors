# Module 8: Development Implementation

## CRITICAL: Agent Execution Rules for This Module

**FOUNDATION LEVERAGE REQUIREMENT**:
- Agents MUST leverage the 70% foundation work completed in Modules 0-7
- ALL implementation decisions MUST reference existing LLD files, research, and documentation
- NO starting from scratch - build upon the comprehensive foundation already established

**DOCKER-NATIVE DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENT**:
- ALL development MUST be Docker-based with no system package installations
- ALL dependencies MUST be managed via requirements.txt
- ALL testing MUST occur within Docker containers with NO workarounds
- If tests fail, fix the code - do NOT create workarounds to make tests pass

**SCRIPT ORGANIZATION REQUIREMENT**:
- Testing scripts MUST go in `project_working_files/scripts/` folder
- Application scripts MUST go in `[project_name]/scripts/` folder
- Every script MUST have a documented purpose and clear location rationale
- NO ad-hoc script generation - scripts created only when specifically needed

**PROJECT IDENTITY REQUIREMENT**:
- ALWAYS reference project_context.md for project name and scope
- MAINTAIN project identity throughout all implementation steps
- ADD to existing documentation, NEVER replace or ignore previous work

## Prerequisites
- Modules 0-7 COMPLETED and validated
- project_context.md exists with project identity
- All LLD files exist and validated in working_files/design/
- implementation_plan/ structure ready with STATUS_README.md
- Docker environment available
- system_info.env exists with current date context

## Module Overview

**Purpose**: Transform the comprehensive planning foundation (Modules 0-7) into actual working code implementation using Docker-native development practices.

**Foundation Utilization**:
- **70% Complete**: Leverage research, LLDs, planning, and task breakdown
- **LLD Integration**: Use Database, DevOps, Coding, UI/UX, and Testing LLDs as implementation blueprints
- **Research Reuse**: Build on Module 1 technology research with current date context
- **Documentation Growth**: Enhance existing documentation with implementation details

**Quality Standards**:
- No system package installations - Docker and requirements.txt only
- No testing workarounds - proper solutions for failing tests
- Structured script organization with clear purposes
- Complete traceability from requirements → LLD → implementation

## Execution Directives

### 8.1 Project Foundation Setup

**MANDATORY PHASE REMINDER**: Before starting this phase, read project_instructions/project_identity_reminder.md to refresh project context, Docker-native requirements, and quality standards.

Execute the following project structure creation steps:

1. **Read Project Identity and Context**
   - Read ../../project_working_files/project_context.md to extract project name
   - Review ../../project_working_files/docs/project_scope.md for project scope
   - Reference ../../project_working_files/docs/technology_stack.md for tech decisions
   - Note project timeline and user base from project context assessment

2. **Create Project Directory Structure**
   - Create `../../[project_name]/` directory at same level as project_working_files
   - Follow directory structure specified in working_files/design/coding_lld.md
   - Create Docker-native structure: Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, requirements.txt
   - Create `../../[project_name]/scripts/` for application lifecycle scripts

3. **Create Testing Infrastructure**
   - Create `../../project_working_files/scripts/` directory for testing scripts
   - Establish clear separation between testing and application scripts
   - Document script organization rationale in implementation notes

4. **Git Repository Initialization (CRITICAL)**
