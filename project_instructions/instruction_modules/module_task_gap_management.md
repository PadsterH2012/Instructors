# Module 4: Task and Gap Management (MANDATORY)

## Overview
This module contains directives for documentation subtask management, iterative development loops, feature management, and gap analysis. This module runs in parallel with LLD creation and continues throughout the documentation process.

## Prerequisites
- Module 3 (LLD Structure and Creation) must be in progress or completed
- All previous module deliverables must be available for reference
- LLD structure must be established

## Execution Directives

### 4.1 Documentation Subtask Management

Execute the following subtask management steps:

1. **Task List Creation**
   - Break down each LLD creation into manageable subtasks
   - Create a temporary task list file (temp_tasks.md in the same directory as instruction.md) for tracking documentation progress

2. **Task Documentation Requirements**
   - For each documentation component:
     - List specific subtasks with clear deliverables
     - Assign priority and estimated effort
     - Track status (Not Started, In Progress, Review, Complete)
     - Update task list as work progresses
     - Check off completed items

3. **Task Management Process**
   - Clear down completed subtasks regularly to maintain focus
   - Use the task list for regular progress tracking
   - Include cross-LLD dependencies in the task list
   - Ensure each subtask has clear acceptance criteria

### 4.2 Iterative Development Loops

Execute the following iterative development processes:

1. **Development Loop (for each LLD section)**
   - Implement the following cycle: Draft → Review → Revise → Validate → Finalize
   - Repeat until section meets quality standards
   - Use temp_tasks.md to track progress through each iteration

2. **Gap Resolution Loop**
   - Implement the following cycle: Identify gaps → Research solutions → Implement fixes → Verify resolution
   - Continue looping until all identified gaps are resolved
   - Document each iteration in missing_detail.md (in the same directory as instruction.md)

3. **Cross-LLD Integration Loop**
   - Implement the following cycle: Review integration points → Identify inconsistencies → Align documentation → Validate
   - Repeat until all cross-LLD references are consistent

4. **Quality Improvement Loop**
   - Implement the following cycle: Collect feedback → Prioritize improvements → Implement changes → Validate
   - Schedule regular review cycles as appropriate for project pace
   - Continue until documentation meets defined quality criteria

5. **Exit Criteria for Loops**
   - Define clear completion criteria for each loop
   - Document verification steps required to exit the loop
   - Require peer approval to consider a loop complete

### 4.3 Feature Management

Execute the following feature management steps:

1. **Feature List Creation**
   - Create feature_list.md (in the same directory as instruction.md) based on project_scope.md
   - Track feature coverage across all LLD documents
   - Mark features as complete when fully documented in relevant LLDs
   - Prioritize features based on dependencies and business value

2. **Feature Tracking Process**
   - Maintain comprehensive feature inventory
   - Map features to specific LLD documents
   - Track implementation status across all documentation
   - Ensure no features are missed or duplicated

### 4.4 Gap Analysis and Resolution

Execute the following gap analysis steps:

1. **Gap Identification**
   - Create missing_detail.md (in the same directory as instruction.md) to document incomplete or unclear specifications
   - Systematically address each item in missing_detail.md

2. **MANDATORY Research Process for Each Gap**
   - For each gap identified, execute the following research process:
     a. Use brave_web_search to research current best practices for the specific gap area
     b. Use resolve-library-id and get-library-docs Context7 tools for technical implementation details
     c. Search for "[gap topic] best practices May 2025 production ready"
     d. Search for "[gap topic] security considerations [technology stack]"
     e. Document research findings and chosen solution approach

3. **Gap Resolution Implementation**
   - Update relevant LLD documents with complete information based on research
   - Continue until all items are resolved with validated solutions
   - Document resolution approach for each gap with references to research sources
   - Create gap_resolution_research.md to track all research performed during gap resolution

4. **Gap Resolution Validation**
   - Verify that all gaps have been addressed with research-backed solutions
   - Ensure gap resolutions are consistent with existing research findings
   - Update related documentation to reflect gap resolutions

### 4.5 Cross-Module Integration

Execute the following integration steps:

1. **Research Integration**
   - Ensure all task and gap management activities reference Module 1 research findings
   - Validate that gap resolutions align with validated technology stack
   - Maintain consistency with industry standards research

2. **Documentation Integration**
   - Ensure task management aligns with Module 2 documentation outputs
   - Verify that feature management covers all project scope requirements
   - Maintain consistency with HLD and techstack documentation

3. **LLD Integration**
   - Coordinate task management with Module 3 LLD creation activities
   - Ensure gap analysis covers all LLD domains
   - Maintain cross-references between task management and LLD outputs

## Validation Checkpoint

Before marking Module 4 as complete, verify that all deliverables are maintained and gaps are resolved:

- [ ] temp_tasks.md exists and is actively maintained
- [ ] feature_list.md exists and tracks all project features
- [ ] missing_detail.md exists and documents all identified gaps
- [ ] gap_resolution_research.md exists and tracks research activities
- [ ] All iterative development loops are properly implemented
- [ ] Task management covers all documentation activities
- [ ] Gap analysis addresses all incomplete specifications
- [ ] Research process is followed for all gap resolutions
- [ ] **MANDATORY**: All major gaps identified with resolution plans
- [ ] **MANDATORY**: High-priority gaps resolved before module completion
- [ ] **MANDATORY**: Medium-priority gaps have concrete action items and timeline
- [ ] **MANDATORY**: Low-priority gaps documented for future phases
- [ ] LLD files updated with gap resolution findings
- [ ] Gap resolution validation documented
- [ ] Status file (../../project_working_files/status.md) updated to COMPLETED

**CRITICAL GAP RESOLUTION REQUIREMENT**:
- **High Priority Gaps**: MUST be resolved immediately using research tools (`brave_web_search`, `Context7`)
- **Medium Priority Gaps**: MUST have specific resolution tasks added to development roadmap
- **Low Priority Gaps**: MUST be documented with clear deferral reasoning and future planning

**MANDATORY**: If any major gaps remain unresolved without concrete resolution plans, repeat the gap analysis and resolution process. Module 4 cannot be marked complete with unresolved major gaps that would impact subsequent modules.

**MANDATORY**: Task and gap management activities must continue throughout the documentation process. Regular updates and maintenance of all deliverables are required.

## Output Files
- temp_tasks.md
- feature_list.md
- missing_detail.md
- gap_resolution_research.md

## Next Module
Upon establishment of task and gap management processes, proceed to Module 5: Validation and Planning.
