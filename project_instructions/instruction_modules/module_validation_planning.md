# Module 5: Validation and Planning (MANDATORY)

## Overview
This module contains directives for validation and alignment processes, project execution planning, and documentation maintenance. This is the final module that ensures all documentation is complete, consistent, and ready for implementation.

## Prerequisites
- Module 4 (Task and Gap Management) must be established and active
- All previous module deliverables must be complete and validated
- LLD creation must be substantially complete
- Task and gap management processes must be operational

## Execution Directives

### 5.1 HLD vs LLD Coverage Analysis (CRITICAL - MANDATORY FIRST)

**MANDATORY HLD COVERAGE VALIDATION REQUIREMENT**:
Execute the following HLD vs LLD gap analysis steps BEFORE any other validation activities:

1. **HLD Analysis and Preparation**
   - Thoroughly analyze project_hld.md for all components and requirements
   - Extract ALL HLD components, interfaces, and requirements
   - Identify system architecture, data flows, and integration points
   - Catalogue all functional and non-functional requirements
   - Establish framework for mapping HLD to LLD coverage

2. **LLD Coverage Analysis**
   - Analyze ALL LLD files from Module 3 for coverage areas
   - Map each HLD component to corresponding LLD sections
   - Verify LLD architecture is consistent with HLD design
   - Ensure all HLD interfaces are completely defined in LLD specifications
   - Verify HLD data flows are fully specified in LLD implementations

3. **HLD vs LLD Gap Identification**
   - Perform systematic comparison of HLD requirements against LLD coverage
   - Identify HLD components completely missing from LLDs
   - Identify HLD components partially covered but lacking detail
   - Identify HLD integration points not properly detailed in LLDs
   - Document ALL identified gaps in hld_coverage_analysis.md

4. **Gap Severity Classification**
   - **MAJOR Gaps**: HLD components completely missing from LLDs (BLOCKING - must resolve)
   - **MEDIUM Gaps**: HLD components partially covered but lacking detail (should resolve or defer with rationale)
   - **MINOR Gaps**: HLD components adequately covered but could be enhanced (document for future)
   - Assign priority based on impact on system implementation
   - Identify gaps that would prevent successful implementation as blocking

5. **Major HLD Coverage Gap Resolution (BLOCKING)**
   - **MANDATORY**: ALL Major gaps (missing HLD coverage) MUST be resolved before Module 5 completion
   - Add all missing HLD components to appropriate LLD files
   - Ensure all HLD architecture elements are properly detailed in LLDs
   - Ensure all HLD integration points are completely specified in LLDs
   - Ensure all critical HLD interfaces are fully defined in LLD specifications

6. **Medium and Minor Gap Management**
   - Medium HLD coverage gaps: Create resolution plan or document rationale for deferral
   - Enhance incomplete HLD coverage or justify deferral
   - Document HLD areas needing more detail with enhancement plan
   - Validate medium gap resolutions against HLD requirements
   - Assess impact of deferred medium HLD gaps on implementation
   - Minor HLD coverage gaps: Document with future enhancement planning

7. **HLD-LLD Consistency Validation**
   - Verify LLD architecture is fully consistent with HLD design
   - Ensure all HLD requirements are traceable to LLD implementations
   - Verify all HLD interfaces are consistently implemented across LLDs
   - Ensure HLD data flows are properly implemented in LLD specifications
   - Validate all HLD integration points are properly detailed in LLDs

8. **Integration Specification Completeness**
   - Map all HLD interfaces to exact LLD implementations with complete signatures
   - Specify complete data flow between components with exact protocols
   - Define exact integration patterns and communication protocols
   - Explicitly define all component dependencies with interaction details
   - Fully specify inter-component communication with exact implementation details
   - Completely define all API contracts with request/response specifications
   - Fully specify all event-driven interactions
   - Specify error handling and propagation between components
   - Clearly define transaction scopes and boundaries across components
   - Fully specify security implementation across component interactions

**CRITICAL COMPLETION CRITERIA**:
- **ALL Major HLD coverage gaps MUST be resolved** (no missing HLD coverage)
- **All Medium HLD coverage gaps** resolved or properly documented for deferral
- **All Minor HLD coverage gaps** documented with future planning
- **Complete HLD vs LLD coverage analysis** documented in hld_coverage_analysis.md
- **HLD fully implemented** in LLD specifications with no blocking gaps

### 5.2 Validation and Alignment

2. **Cross-Domain Review Process**
   - Conduct peer reviews of documentation with representatives from each domain
   - Ensure LLDs complement each other at integration points
   - Validate that improvements in one LLD are reflected appropriately in related LLDs
   - Hold cross-domain review sessions to ensure cohesive documentation

3. **Iterative Development Loop Application**
   - Apply the iterative development loops defined in Module 4 section 4.2
   - Use the Cross-LLD Integration Loop specifically for validation activities
   - Continue validation cycles until all inconsistencies are resolved

4. **Technology Stack Validation**
   - Verify techstack.md is consistent with all LLDs and HLD
   - Ensure all components in techstack.md are properly referenced in relevant documentation
   - Validate that all technology choices align with Module 1 research findings

### 5.2 Research Integration Validation

Execute the following research integration validation steps:
