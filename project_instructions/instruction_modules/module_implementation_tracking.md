---

## Overview
This module creates a comprehensive implementation tracking system that breaks down the high-level project plan into manageable, trackable tasks. It provides structured progress tracking at the task level while maintaining integration with the existing resume and status systems.

## Prerequisites
- **Module 6 must be COMPLETED** - verify in ../../project_working_files/status.md
- high_level_plan.md file exists in ../../project_working_files/docs/
- All LLD files exist in ../../project_working_files/working_files/design/
- Project scope and requirements are finalized

## Execution Directives

### 7.1 High-Level Plan Analysis

Execute the following analysis steps:

1. **Read and Parse High-Level Plan**
   - Read ../../project_working_files/docs/high_level_plan.md
   - Extract all phases and their current structure
   - Identify tasks and subtasks within each phase
   - Note dependencies and validation requirements

2. **Validate Phase Structure**
   - Verify phase dependencies are logical
   - Confirm task breakdown is comprehensive
   - Check that all LLD domains are represented
   - Validate testing and documentation requirements

3. **Calculate Task Metrics**
   - Count total tasks per phase
   - Estimate task complexity and duration
   - Identify critical path dependencies
   - Plan progress tracking intervals

### 7.2 Implementation Plan Directory Structure Creation

Execute the following structure creation steps:

1. **Create Implementation Plan Directory**
   - Create ../../project_working_files/implementation_plan/ directory
   - This becomes the master implementation tracking location
   - Ensure proper permissions and accessibility

2. **Create Phase Directories**
   - Create one directory per phase from high_level_plan.md
   - Use naming format: phase{number}_{name} (e.g., phase1_foundation)
   - Maximum 8-10 phase directories for manageability
   - Each directory will contain detailed task breakdown

3. **Directory Structure Validation**
   - Verify all phase directories created successfully
   - Confirm directory naming consistency
   - Test directory accessibility and permissions

### 7.3 Master Index Creation

Execute the following master index creation steps:

1. **Create plan_index.md**
   - Create ../../project_working_files/implementation_plan/plan_index.md
   - Include master implementation tracking overview
   - List all phases with current status (NOT_STARTED initially)
   - Include overall project completion percentage (0% initially)
   - Add links to individual phase folders and task files

2. **Index Content Requirements**
   The plan_index.md file must include:
   - Overall project completion progress bar
   - Phase-by-phase status summary with progress bars
   - Quick navigation links to all phase directories
   - References to high_level_plan.md and other documentation
   - Last updated timestamp and update instructions
   - Integration notes for resume system compatibility

3. **Progress Visualization Implementation**
   - Use table format for clear progress display
   - Include status icons, progress bars, task counts, and ETA estimates
   - Calculate progress as (completed tasks / total tasks) × 100%
   - Update automatically when task statuses change
   - Provide comprehensive status information in organized format

### 7.4 Phase Task Breakdown Creation

Execute the following task breakdown steps:

1. **Create tasks.md Files**
   - Create tasks.md file in each phase directory
   - Break down high_level_plan.md tasks into actionable items
   - Maximum 20-30 tasks per phase for manageability
   - Use checkbox format: [ ] (not started), [~] (in progress), [x] (completed)

2. **Task Structure Requirements**
   Each tasks.md file must include:
   - Phase overview and status summary
   - Detailed task checklist with status checkboxes
   - Testing requirements for each task
   - Documentation requirements for each task
   - References to relevant LLD files
   - Dependencies and validation criteria
   - Progress tracking and update instructions

3. **Task Breakdown Principles**
   - Each task should be completable in 1-4 hours
   - Tasks must have clear completion criteria
   - Include both implementation and validation steps
   - Reference specific LLD sections and requirements
   - Maintain traceability to high-level plan

### 7.5 Status Dashboard Creation

Execute the following dashboard creation steps:

1. **Create STATUS_README.md**
   - Create ../../project_working_files/STATUS_README.md
   - Place in root of project_working_files for maximum visibility
   - Include overall project progress overview
   - Provide quick status summary for all phases

2. **Dashboard Content Requirements**
   The STATUS_README.md file must include:
   - Overall project progress summary with completion percentage
   - Comprehensive phase status table with all key information
   - Current focus and next milestone information
   - Quick links to detailed implementation tracking
   - Links to project documentation and resources
   - Last updated timestamp and update schedule

3. **Progress Table Format**
   Use table format for all progress displays:
   ```markdown
   | Phase | Status | Progress | Tasks | ETA |
   |-------|--------|----------|-------|-----|
   | 1 | ✅ Complete | ████████████ 100% | 15/15 | Done |
   | 2 | 🔄 Active | ██████░░░░░░ 50% | 8/16 | 3 days |
   | 3 | ⏸️ Pending | ░░░░░░░░░░░░ 0% | 0/12 | TBD |
   ```
   - Include status icons for quick visual identification
   - Show progress bars using Unicode block characters
   - Display task completion ratios
   - Provide estimated completion times where applicable

### 7.6 Resume System Integration

Execute the following integration steps:

1. **Analyze Current Resume System**
   - Read ../../project_instructions/instruction_modules/module_resume_system.md
   - Understand current resume logic and capabilities
   - Identify integration points for task-level tracking

2. **Enhance Resume System Logic**
   - Update module_resume_system.md to recognize implementation_plan structure
   - Add task-level resume capability within phases
   - Implement priority logic: implementation_plan > high_level_plan.md > status.md
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing systems

3. **Resume Integration Requirements**
   When implementation_plan exists:
   - Resume from specific incomplete task within current phase
   - Update task status as work progresses
   - Propagate task completion to phase and overall progress
   - Fall back to high_level_plan.md if implementation_plan is corrupted

## Validation Checkpoint

Before marking Module 7 as complete, verify:

- [ ] High-level plan analysis completed and documented
- [ ] implementation_plan/ directory structure created successfully
- [ ] plan_index.md created with comprehensive phase overview
- [ ] All phase directories created with consistent naming
- [ ] tasks.md files created for each phase with detailed breakdowns
- [ ] STATUS_README.md created in project_working_files root
- [ ] Progress bars and status tracking implemented correctly
- [ ] Resume system integration updated and tested
- [ ] Task-level resume capability functional
- [ ] Backward compatibility with existing systems maintained
- [ ] All links and references working correctly
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect new tracking system
- [ ] Status file (../../project_working_files/status.md) updated to COMPLETED

**MANDATORY**: If any tracking system component is missing or incomplete, repeat the relevant creation steps. The implementation tracking system becomes the primary mechanism for actual project development progress.

**STATUS UPDATE REQUIREMENT**: Update ../../project_working_files/status.md to COMPLETED status with timestamp and completion summary.

## Output Files
- ../../project_working_files/implementation_plan/plan_index.md (master tracking index)
- ../../project_working_files/implementation_plan/phase{N}_{name}/tasks.md (detailed task breakdowns)
- ../../project_working_files/STATUS_README.md (status dashboard)
- Updated module_resume_system.md (enhanced with task-level tracking)
- Updated status tracking with Module 7 completion

## Next Steps
Upon successful completion of Module 7, the project instruction system is enhanced with comprehensive implementation tracking. The implementation_plan structure becomes the primary guide for actual development work, with task-level resume capability and detailed progress tracking.

## Integration Notes
- This module extends but does not replace the high-level planning system
- Implementation tracking works alongside existing status.md and high_level_plan.md
- Resume system gains task-level granularity while maintaining compatibility
- Progress tracking becomes more detailed and actionable for development work
