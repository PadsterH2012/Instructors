### Accuracy Breakdown (Last 15 Runs Average)

| Category | Weight | Average Score | Trend |
|----------|--------|---------------|-------|
| File Operations | 25% | 89.2% | ‚ÜóÔ∏è |
| Command Execution | 25% | 86.8% | ‚ÜóÔ∏è |
| API Calls | 20% | 84.1% | ‚ÜîÔ∏è |
| Time Estimates | 15% | 82.3% | ‚ÜòÔ∏è |
| Issue Prediction | 15% | 85.7% | ‚ÜóÔ∏è |

### Issue Patterns

#### Common Issues by Level
**L7-L9 (Intensive)**:
- Complex deployment scenarios underestimated
- Enterprise security requirements missed
- Performance optimization steps incomplete

**L4-L6 (Medium)**:
- Integration complexity underestimated
- Database migration steps missed
- Testing coverage gaps

**L1-L3 (Basic)**:
- Minor path resolution issues
- Occasional dependency version mismatches

#### Improvement Areas
1. **Time Estimation**: Consistently underestimated by 15-20%
2. **Enterprise Deployments**: Complex scenarios need better modeling
3. **API Call Prediction**: Research needs often exceed simulation estimates

### Recommendations

#### Short-term Improvements
