## Core Functionality Modules (Support)

### Task Breakdown System

**Key Features**:
- **CRITICAL**: Resolves "tool input too large" errors
- Strict input size management (max 300 lines save-file, max 200 lines str-replace-editor)
- LLD processing limits (use view_range, never process entire files)
- Reference-based approach instead of content copying
- **MANDATORY**: All agents must follow this framework to prevent size errors

## Module Dependencies

### Sequential Dependencies
- Module 0 (Initial Setup) must be completed before any other modules can begin
- All modules must reference and build upon outputs from previous modules
- Research findings from Module 1 must be integrated into all subsequent modules
- LLD documents from Module 3 must be validated in Module 5

### Cross-Module Integration
- Task management from Module 4 applies to all documentation activities
- Module 6 synthesizes all outputs from Modules 1-5 into a comprehensive project roadmap
- Module 7 creates implementation tracking based on Module 6's high-level plan
- Module 8 transforms the planning foundation into actual code implementation using LLD specifications

### Validation Requirements
- All project instructions must be validated against the project_plan.txt file before execution
- Status tracking from Module 0 must be maintained throughout all subsequent modules
- High-level plan from Module 6 becomes the primary progress tracking system when created
- Implementation tracking from Module 7 provides task-level progress monitoring for actual development

## Module Execution Guidelines

### Status Tracking
- Each module updates the unified status tracking system
- Status file location: `../../project_working_files/status.md`
- Enables resume capability from any interruption point
- Provides module-level and task-level progress tracking

### Quality Assurance
- Each module includes validation checkpoints
- Research-first approach required for all decisions
- No assumptions without explicit research validation
- Comprehensive documentation of all decisions and rationale

### Tool Usage Requirements
- `brave_web_search` for technology research with current date context
- `Context7` tools for component compatibility research
- File creation tools following size management guidelines
- Debug logging when enabled for transparency and troubleshooting

### Output Standards
- All outputs must be properly organized in designated directories
- File naming conventions must be followed consistently
- Documentation must be comprehensive and self-contained
- Cross-references between modules must be maintained

## Best Practices

### Module Execution
- Read entire module instructions before beginning
- Validate prerequisites before starting each module
- Follow the specified sequence and dependencies
- Update status tracking throughout execution

### Quality Management
- Use research-first approach for all decisions
- Validate outputs against requirements and specifications
- Maintain comprehensive documentation throughout
- Follow size management guidelines to prevent tool errors

### Problem Resolution
- Use debug mode for troubleshooting complex issues
- Log issues and workarounds in tracking system
