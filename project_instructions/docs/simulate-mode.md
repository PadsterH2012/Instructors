# ðŸŽ­ Simulate Mode

## Overview

Simulate mode provides risk-free testing of instruction logic with scalable complexity levels and targeted switches. It logs all actions that would be performed without actually executing them, making it perfect for testing and validation.

## Execution Commands

### Basic Simulation
```
Follow the instructions in project_instructions/project_instruction_index.md and resume from current status.

--simulate
```

### Level-Based Simulation
```
Follow the instructions in project_instructions/project_instruction_index.md and resume from current status.

--simulate-basic     # Level 1-3: Simple projects
--simulate-medium    # Level 4-6: Complex projects  
--simulate-intensive # Level 7-9: Enterprise projects
```

### Switch-Based Simulation
```
Follow the instructions in project_instructions/project_instruction_index.md and resume from current status.

--simulate-medium --simulate-testing --simulate-debug
```

## Simulation Configuration

### Required Context
```
## Simulation Configuration
Level: [1-9] (1=Basic, 5=Medium, 9=Intensive)
Switches: [--simulate-testing, --simulate-debug, --simulate-upgrade, --simulate-deployment]
Project Type: [Detected from project context or specified]
Working Directory: [Full path where agent is executing - MUST be established at start]
Project Root: [Full path to project root directory]
```

### Working Directory Establishment
- Agents MUST establish and log their current working directory (pwd) at the start of execution
- This working directory context is CRITICAL for accurate relative path calculations
- All file operations and command executions depend on this established working directory
- Log the full path (e.g., `/home/user/ProjectA`) for reference throughout execution

## Simulate Mode Rules

- âœ… **API calls scale with level**: L1-3 (1 call), L4-6 (2 calls), L7-9 (3 calls)
- âœ… **Operations complexity increases** with level
- âœ… **Switches add specific operation types** to simulation
- âœ… **No actual changes** made to files or system
- âœ… **Level and timestamp-based** logging format
- âœ… **Full command paths** with working directory context
- âœ… **Executable commands** that could be run directly

## Accuracy Tracking System

### Post-Execution Assessment

After actual execution, simulation accuracy can be assessed and tracked:

### Accuracy Categories (weighted)
- **File Operations** (25%): Did simulated file operations match actual execution?
- **Command Execution** (25%): Did simulated commands match what was actually run?
- **API Calls** (20%): Did simulated research match actual research performed?
- **Time Estimates** (15%): How close were simulated time estimates to actual execution?
- **Issue Prediction** (15%): Did simulation predict actual issues encountered?

### Example Accuracy Assessment
```
=== ACCURACY ASSESSMENT ===
Phase: Environment and Configuration Implementation
Module: Module 8.2
Overall Accuracy: 87%
- File Operations: 95% - All Docker files created as simulated, minor path differences
- Command Execution: 90% - Docker commands matched, additional troubleshooting commands needed
- API Calls: 80% - Simulated 2 calls, actually needed 3 for Docker optimization
- Time Estimates: 75% - Estimated 20 min, actual 26 min due to container issues
- Issue Prediction: 85% - Predicted Docker build issues, missed network configuration problem
Notes: Simulation was very close to actual execution, good predictive accuracy

## File Location

**Simulation logs are stored in**: `simulate/simulate_log.md`

This location is:
- Part of instruction system infrastructure
- Excluded from project repository via .gitignore
- Separate from project development files
- Easy to access for review and analysis
