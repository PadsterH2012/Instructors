i would like a docker container that will run an application that will allow audio communication between 2 users, it can be either push talk to open. there should also have a messaging system built in as well. to allow text to be sent between users as well.
it should have an audio bell/notification when a new message comes in, and a ringing sound when trying to initiate an audio connection.

this will be primarily used from a windows device, it should be secure and encrypted.
i want the interface to be simple and easy for my 7 year old daughter to speak to me whilst playing minecraft

maybe it should have a minecraft theme
other features would be webcam support
emotes as well
server backend will run in a docker container
there is no budget, its a solo agent dev
full features.
it must look stunning and professional
